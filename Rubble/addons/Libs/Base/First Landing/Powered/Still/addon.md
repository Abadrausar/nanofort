The auto-still takes any brew-able plant and produces alcohol (and seeds if needed).

This workshop is invaluable! So long as you keep it supplied it will provide all the alcohol you
could ever need without the hassle of constantly needing to queue up brewing jobs. This is one of
the most useful auto-workshops, and it only becomes more useful as your fortress grows.

Take care not to pile too many plants/fruits on the input, as if you have a barrel shortage they may
rot. Use a sorter to limit the number (just one plant/fruit at a time should be good enough).

Barrels are (of course) required.

Automated workshops require more mechanical power than normal workshops, as well as
items like mechanical arms (which require electronic components). In general these
workshops are intended for use in established settlements.
