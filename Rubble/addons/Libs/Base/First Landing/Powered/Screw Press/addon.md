The powered screw press takes any item that has a press recipe registered and presses it
into whatever products the recipe specifies.

By default recipes are provided to match the vanilla screw press.

Jugs are required.

Recipe selection is completely automatic, the first one it finds that OKs the input
item being considered is the one used.

Automated workshops require more mechanical power than normal workshops, as well as
items like mechanical arms (which require electronic components). In general these
workshops are intended for use in established settlements.
