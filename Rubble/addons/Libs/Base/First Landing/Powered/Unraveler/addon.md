Unneeded clothing can be fed in and reduced to cloth for remaking into useful stuff.
Worn clothing has a chance to not produce anything (the more worn the greater the chance).

Leather items can also be recycled, but the chance of getting usable leather is lower
than the chance cloth items.

The cloth quality is never higher than the quality of the item, and the item is also bleached
(dye removed).

If you feed in cloth (not items made from cloth, the cloth itself) it will be unraveled
into thread (with, once again, a chance to fail).

Automated workshops require more mechanical power than normal workshops, as well as
items like mechanical arms (which require electronic components). In general these
workshops are intended for use in established settlements.
