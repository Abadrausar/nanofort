The auto-mill takes any item that has a mill recipe registered and mills it
into whatever products the recipe specifies.

Jugs or bags may be required, depending on the recipe.

When milling plants with the default recipe seeds are produced (if possible,
they will not be created for seedless plants).

Recipe selection is completely automatic, the first one it finds that OKs the input
item being considered is the one used.

Mods may add new mill recipes via a simple but powerful Lua API.

Automated workshops require more mechanical power than normal workshops, as well as
items like mechanical arms (which require electronic components). In general these
workshops are intended for use in established settlements.
