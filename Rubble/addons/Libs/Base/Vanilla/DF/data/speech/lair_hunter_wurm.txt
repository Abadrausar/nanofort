I'm older than the stars, child!
I've wandered the depths. And I'll finish you!
All hope is lost. The stars require it.
Fool! You, can not stop me.
There is no escape for you and yours.
Dare attempt to interfere with my plans? Perish.
Just in the nick of time. I'm starved.
Uninvited guests? Your time has come.
Stay for dinner? I insist.
You, must be lost. Fair you unwell.
