# Haiku Vanilla 
This is DF with the minimal number of active objects to have *all* the basics of a functional vanilla *without modifying any of them* only pruning all the non redundant object into a separate minimal directory nested inside the base of their type.
# What we have until now is:
1. 10 Creatures: 1 wagon,3 vermin,1 colonies (bees), 3 domestics (dog, cat and donkey) 2 civilized (dwarves and goblins) and nothing more. For the variety you have the titans, FB semiFB, night creatures and rest of random.
2. 34 Inorganics: 5 to enable adventure coins, 6 for the bronze line, 5 for the steel line, 3 for the deep specials, and 15 for the rest: stones and ores.
3. 21 Plants: 2 grass one subterranean (cave moss) another above ground (meadow-grass), 8 crops: 6 subterranean (Cave wheat, Dimple cup, Pig tail, Plump helmet, Quarry bush and Sweet pod) and 2 above ground (Sliver barb and Whip vine), 11 trees 7 subterranean (Black-cap, Blood thorn, Fungiwood, Goblin-cap, Nether-cap, Spore tree, Tower-cap and Tunnel tube)  and 4 above ground (glumprong, feather tree, highwood and willow) 
4. That makes a great total of 65 active objects to play with, nothing more (this is not strictly true) nothing less; AND HEY!, before you begin to protest, remember that this is a minimal mod done in the interest of SCIENCE, it could be FUN to play or not (it is up to you to see and decide), but this is not certainly the unique objective of this mod not even the primary.

The number of active objects have been already dramatically reduced (good news for your FPS) but I think that it could be reduced even further, some more SCIENCE required... When you experiment trying to remove even more objects you will find some of the hard limits of the game.

# Some of those hard limits already more or less identified:
1. It seems that you must have at least two entities defined to elude world generation rejects.
2. A wagon creature must be define in order to be able to start the game in fort mode.
3. You need at least the vanilla base language files and then the specifics language files of the creature of your civilization if those creatures are able to speak.
4. BODY, BODY_DETAIL_PLAN, BOOK, BUILDING, DESCRIPTOR_COLOR, DESCRIPTOR_PATTERN, DESCRIPTOR_SHAPE, INTERACTION, ITEM, MATERIAL_TEMPLATE, REACTION, SECRET and TISSUE_TEMPLATE have not been investigated for pruning.
