	Every plant needs a structural material so that the game knows how it behaves when it's alive.

	Here the material is added to the plant, using a template from the material file.

		[MATERIAL_VALUE:2]
		[MATERIAL_REACTION_PRODUCT:DRINK_MAT:LOCAL_PLANT_MAT:DRINK]
		[MATERIAL_REACTION_PRODUCT:SEED_MAT:LOCAL_PLANT_MAT:SEED]

	Here the material is marked as the structural material (this could be below the edible tags which come next).  In general, you can use LOCAL_PLANT_MAT|<token>, PLANT_MAT|<plant>|<token>, CREATURE_MAT|<creature>|<token> or INORGANIC|IRON (though the game might hiccup for a while specifically on plants that aren't structurally plants).
	[BASIC_MAT:LOCAL_PLANT_MAT:STRUCTURAL]

		We also modify it a bit to make the plant edible.  Any token material can be used here to modify the material that was created from the template.

	Next we establish an alcohol material in much the same way as the structural material.
	
	[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:DRINK:PLANT_ALCOHOL_TEMPLATE]
		The material template is just called "alcohol" so we need to give it a proper name.
		[STATE_NAME_ADJ:ALL_SOLID:frozen dwarven wine]
		[STATE_NAME_ADJ:LIQUID:dwarven wine]
		[STATE_NAME_ADJ:GAS:boiling dwarven wine]
		We also set a few more numbers to distinguish the alcohol from the template.

	The seed material and information is established in a similar fashion.  Other plants (including trees) add materials in the same way, though trees cannot be used at this time with seeds/thread/drink etc.  They just use the TREE tag to obtain a wood material (they also have a structural material for their live form).
