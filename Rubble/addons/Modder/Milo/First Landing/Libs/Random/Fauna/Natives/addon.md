Currently the creature names, descriptions, pref strings, bodies, etc are all randomly generated from
information stored in the "body tables". Descriptions and pref strings are quite limited, as I have
not put enough information into the tables for them yet.

You can set how many creatures you want with the provided configuration variable, the default is 5.
