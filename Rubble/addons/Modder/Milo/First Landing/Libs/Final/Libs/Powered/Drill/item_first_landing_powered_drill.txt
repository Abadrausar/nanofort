[OBJECT:ITEM]

# Production support for this item is in the base, as it is simpler to insert some conditional
# special case code there than to make make a way to insert production reactions in the correct
# spots from external addons. If i needed to do several items like this I would use an API, but
# it's not worth it for just one.
