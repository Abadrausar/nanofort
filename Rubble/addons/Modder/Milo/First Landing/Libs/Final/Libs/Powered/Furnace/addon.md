The auto-furnace is really simple, items go in, and other items come out. Many different interactions
are possible. This workshops plays an important part of many production lines, and it also works well
when used by itself.

For example if you want to make lots of pottery it may be a very good idea to use one of these to
fire it, as skill is not important to firing. You can simply pile all your pottery items on the input
to dry and the auto-furnace will fire them as soon as they are dry enough to do so.

Not all furnace products can be made here (for example clear and crystal glass need to be made at
the fuel or arc smelter), but most can be. In addition there are some special actions that can only
be done here, for example burning corpses to ash or recycling glass items.

Full list of possible actions:

* Coal -> Coke
* Wood plank -> Charcoal
* Ore -> Metal
* Sand bags -> Raw green glass + empty bag
* Dry ceramic -> Fired ceramic
* Any metal item -> Metal bars
* Any glass item -> Raw glass
* Any organic item -> Ash
* Any other item -> Pass unchanged

Unlike many automated workshops there are no invalid inputs that will damage the workshop.

This is far and away the most flexible auto-workshop, with the more interactions than any
other.

Keep in mind that like all auto-workshops this is dangerous to your citizens! If you let someone
wander near an operating auto-furnace don't be surprised if they end up dead and have their corpse
turned into a bar of ash! And while something like a human bone table (a possible result of a disaster
at the auto-assembler) may be kind of cool (Hey everybody, lets go eat at Aunt Ema!), a bar of ash
is just a boring old bar of ash.

Automated workshops require more mechanical power than normal workshops, as well as
items like mechanical arms (which require electronic components). In general these
workshops are intended for use in established settlements.
