Both above and underground plants are generated, and they may have a wide variety of uses.

Plants will fall into the following broad categories:

* Fruit: Brew into wine, eat raw or cooked. Most common type.
* Grain: Mill into flour, brew into whiskey or beer.
* Sugar: Brew into rum, mill into sugar or paste, press paste for syrup (more value than sugar).
* Oil: Mill into paste, press for oil (oil is edible cooked). This category may combine with fruit.
* Dye: Mill into dye powder. This category may combine with fruit.
* Thread: Spin into thread. This category may combine with dye (very rare) or grain.
* Storage (jug): Scrape clean and dry to make a jug. Rare and cannot combine with anything.
* Storage (bag): Use tough but flexible leaves to make a bag. Rare and cannot combine with anything.

Plants that combine two categories are rare, and the dye/thread combo is especially so. That said fruit/oil combos are
fairly common.

You may get lucky and have a dye/thread plant that is fast growing (a fine foundation for a strong economy), or you could
end up with nothing but slow growing stuff that requires processing before it may be eaten, it is up to the whims of RNG.

Most plants will appear anywhere the temperature is "not freezing" or in one of the cavern layers, but some plants will
only show in the tropical, temperate, wetland, or desert areas.

Plant attributes may be identified by looking at the seed name. Each seed will have a two or three letter code that
specifies what it may be used for and where it grows.

* The first one or two letters specify uses:
	* `'F'`: Fruit
	* `'G'`: Grain
	* `'S'`: Sugar
	* `'O'`: Oil
	* `'D'`: Dye
	* `'T'`: Thread
	* `'J'`: Storage (jug)
	* `'B'`: Storage (bag)
* The final letter specifies the plant's biome:
	* `'U'`: Any Cavern
	* `'A'`: Any Non-Freezing (no mountains, tundra, or glacier)
	* `'N'`: Temperate
	* `'T'`: Tropical
	* `'W'`: Wetlands
	* `'D'`: Desert
