The powered decorator takes any improvable item and dyes or encrusts it with any powder (sugar
encrusted tables for the dining hall? Sure why not!).

If the powder material is flagged as a glaze and the item can be glazed the item will be glazed
instead of encrusted. Keep in mind that only dry unfired items can be glazed, and the item then
needs to be fired to set the glaze

Automated workshops require more mechanical power than normal workshops, as well as
items like mechanical arms (which require electronic components). In general these
workshops are intended for use in established settlements.
