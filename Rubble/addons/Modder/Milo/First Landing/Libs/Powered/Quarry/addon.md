The auto-quarry is very simple, if built over the correct tile it provides clay or
sand, automatically. Sand mining requires bags, place them on an input tile.

Output is placed beyond an output tile (which is required). If multiple output tiles are
provided one is chosen at random each time (so output may be split).

Automated workshops require more mechanical power than normal workshops, as well as
items like mechanical arms (which require electronic components). In general these
workshops are intended for use in established settlements.
