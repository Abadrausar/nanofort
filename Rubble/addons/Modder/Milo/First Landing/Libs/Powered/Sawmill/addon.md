This is an automated version of the normal sawmill, as such it is faster and requires no
labor to operate, only mechanical power.

Any wood or stone item may be input and cut into blocks or planks, but anything but logs
and boulders will produce only one block/plank.

Automated workshops require more mechanical power than normal workshops, as well as
items like mechanical arms (which require electronic components). In general these
workshops are intended for use in established settlements.
