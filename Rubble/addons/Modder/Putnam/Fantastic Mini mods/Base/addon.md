# Complete dragonball lore.
- One of the DFHackiest mods in existence, very necessary!
- Ki adds power to strikes and allows faster movement; requires DFHack.
- Playable Saiyans.
- Saiyans can go Super Saiyan (and beyond), which multiplies their power; requires DFHack.
- Planet Trade Organizations as an invading race, led by a fearsome frost demon*.
- Androids, bionic androids, Majin Buu, immortal makyans, God of Destruction Beerus, legendary super saiyans, super nameks, frost demons*, oh my!
- Secrets of ki usage; humans can figure out or be taught by gods how to use ki and develop the Turtle School or Crane School of martial arts.
- Certain priests may get the privilege of undergoing a ritual to have their potential unlocked by Old Kai.
- Peaceful namekians.
- Dragon Balls.
# Ki:
> Ki is a type of energy that all living things are capable of utilizing; its main use, however, is in battle. Ki is made up of three components: Genki, Yuki and Shoki, meaning approximately "energy", "courage" and "mind" respectively.
> In Sparking, Genki is determined by endurance, Yuki by willpower and Shoki by focus. Putting ki into an attack increases the attack's velocity and thus prepare/recover time; the velocity is directly increased and the prepare/recover time decrease is represented by every other unit on the map having their actions take longer (this is primarily so that actions can be made more than ~9 ticks faster, if only by making everyone else 200 ticks slower).
> How much of an individual's ki potential goes into an attack is determined by a mix of factors, depending on which kind of ki:
> Genki is affected by health, though fighting skill mitigates the issues (and will reduce the amount of genki available when below proficient)
> Yuki is affected by various emotions; most postive emotions will hearten an individual and most negative emotions will dishearten them. Discipline skill mitigates this. Some negative emotions will hearten an individual:

1. Rage
2. Wrath
3. Anger
4. Ferocity
5. Bitterness
6. Hatred
7. Loathing
8. Outrage

> Shoki is affected by stress; the more stressed a unit, the worse their shoki control is. Discipline mitigates this.

# Scouter
> By using the command dragonball/scouter, one can see the power level of an individual unit.
> Using it without an argument will give you the standard weighted battle power, which is equivalent to their current ki level squared divided by 2500.
> Using it with the -citizens argument will give you the weighted battle powers of all of your citizens.
> Using it with the -all argument will give you the weighted battle powers of all units on the map who have one.
> Using it with the -accurate argument will replace the weighted battle power simply with the unit's willpower+focus+endurance, which is the basic initial calculation for ki. This is the unit's current potential, not counting transformations or multipliers (so a super saiyan will still have an -accurate level of 10,000 even when they actually have 510,000 ki and a battle power of 104,040,000).
> Using it with the -legacy argument will give you the earlier battle power calculation, which was based on body size, exhaustion, attributes, windedness and other things.
