[OBJECT:DESCRIPTOR_PATTERN]

{@IF;${TESB_LIVING_STONE};NEVER;
Living stone feature has been disabled.  Therefore there is no need for the Awakened Magma's custom color pattern.;
Blackbody color for magma at 12000 degrees Urist is close to scarlet, but the game assigns it the color orange.  This is a compromise.
