Differences from non-Rubble Version

1. Only the Rubble version has configuration settings.  The non-Rubble version is equivalent to the Rubble version with all configuration settings set to defaults.

2. Only the non-Rubble version has Stonesense content.

3. The non-Rubble version follows the old convention of placing all creature graphics in a subfolder.
