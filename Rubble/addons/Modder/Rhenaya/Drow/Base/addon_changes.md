*albino drow no longer cave adapts

v1.8
*changed tag for drowspider to align with new vermin hunter tags (FINALLY!) for v.20

v1.7
*added new jobs to drow (beekeeping doesnt make sense for now but there are actually deep honey insects, maybe we can get colony vermin for underground too)

*giant lizards lay eggs like crocs (only reptile with lay eggs for now in vanilla?)

*renamed mithral into mithralsteel to make sure noone confuses it with mithril (although it may be very hard to obtain now with scarse lead and mithril vines)

* agility is lowered for drow for some better balancing
* drow are able to be converted into night creatures
