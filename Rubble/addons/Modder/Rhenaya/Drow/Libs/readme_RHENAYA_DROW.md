for simple use just leave the files as they are.

if you want dwarfs (or any other race) to be able to use mithral steel add the
	[PERMITTED_REACTION:RHENAYAS_DROW_MITHRAL_MAKING]
to them.

for the silkmilk of giant drowspiders use
	[PERMITTED_BUILDING:RHENAYAS_SPIDERY]
	[PERMITTED_REACTION:RHENAYAS_SILK_FROM_SILKMILK]


if you want only drow or dwarf playable delete the brackets from [CIV_CONTROLLABLE] in the specific entity

if you want to be drow always hostile (and capture slaves) add brackets to the BABY_SNATCHER tag
