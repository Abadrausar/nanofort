Tile Size	24×24
Resolution	1920×600 (80x25 grid size); 1920×1200 (80x50 grid size)
Comments	Inspired by the Terminus24 tileset, I created this square 24x24 tileset. Almost all symbols have been redrawn antialiased; so a DF version supporting transparent PNGs must be used. In order to use unscaled tiles, horizontal resolution must be at least 1920.
This is the 20x20 version of my 24x24 tileset. Graphical tiles have been replaced by ASCII ones. A DF version supporting transparent PNGs must be used. In order to use unscaled tiles, horizontal resolution must be at least 1600.

The 24x24 tilesheet:

The 20x20 tilesheet:

This addon makes no raw changes, so it should be usable with all ASCII compatible mods.
