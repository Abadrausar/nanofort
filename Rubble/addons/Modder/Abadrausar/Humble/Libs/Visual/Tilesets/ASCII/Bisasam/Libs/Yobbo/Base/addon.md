Comments	A modified version of Bisasam's 20x20 tileset above. Almost all symbols have been redrawn antialiased; so a DF version supporting transparent PNGs must be used. Walls were changed to make smooth curves and circles, broken arrows were changed to look broken, periods and commas were raised to center more closely on the tile, the seed tile was changed to help distinguish the current level and the one below, and a leaf / root tile was added for the new trees. There may have been a couple other minor changes, but the feel of the tileset should still be the same.

The 20x20 tilesheet:

This addon makes no raw changes, so it should be usable with all ASCII compatible mods.
