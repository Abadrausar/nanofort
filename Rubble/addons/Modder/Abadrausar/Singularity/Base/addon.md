# In the Singularity the entire multiverse is collapsing into a singular world. 
Time and space are no more. What this means? Well! you can have a hight tech civilization next to another that is low tech or even primitive.You can even have a race in two different and simultaneous settings: medieval fantasy and SCI-TECH (Warhammer 40000 eldars),magic, unicorns and other unique content.
This mod will include a new race the archeopterys with a very special lore and every other rubblized mod made able of coexist with all the others. Ambitious, no?
This mod will be very hard to stabilize, so it will not happen in the immediate future... That this is OP and not balanced? Sure, I really feel pity for the few braves fools enough to try it!!!
And a little bit of admiration ;)
