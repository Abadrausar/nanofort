This is a Graphic set for Dwarf Fortress, intended to be used with ASCII-like tilesets with a tile size of 18x18px such as Haowan or Myne.

I made a Graphic set that tries to keep the simplicity and ease-of-recognition of ASCII-like tilesets and add a little beauty and variety of graphic sets.

It includes graphics for all creatures in the game: the Civs (Dwarves, Elves, Humans, Goblins, Kobolds and the various underground civs: antmen, cave swallow men and so on.), as well as all animals, monsters, giant versions and animalmen. Some creatures use the same graphics, though they still have different colors (most fish, and smaller birds, for example).
It lets the game determine the color of everything, meaning that you can still easily discern how many marksmen and how many lashers the vile force of darkness just sent to kill you their untimely death at first glance.
Animals are now slightly altered, very adorable letters.



It comes preinstalled with the newest DF version (as soon as I get to update it), its own Color Scheme, the TrueType font "ProFont", and two 18x18 Tilesets. By default it uses "CLA" (the one in the sample images). If you want to try the other one (a clean version of the default square 16x16, based on Haowan's), open data/init.txt and replace all 4 instances of "CLA.png" with "Myne.png".
Taffer also made a version of his tileset to be compatible with the CLA creature graphics. Get it here!


HOW TO INSTALL MANUALLY:
0-delete everything in raw/graphics and data/saves/region#/raw/graphics (if you have existing saves) 
1-copy all files in DF folder and overwrite everything if prompted.
2-for existing saves, copy the new contents of raw/graphics into data/saves/region#/raw/graphics



HOW TO INSTALL GRAPHIC SET ONLY:

0-delete or move all files in raw/graphics (other graphic sets, example graphics).
1-put graphic set files (raw/graphics/: the folder 'CLA' and the textfiles) into raw/graphics.
2-Open data/init.txt with a text editor such as notepad (I suggest notepad++) and change [GRAPHICS:NO] to [GRAPHICS:YES].
3-generate new world and embark!

If you already have a save, you need to copy the files into data/saves/region#/raw/graphics instead
