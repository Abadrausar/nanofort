In this mod I did a lot of random stuff.

If you want to use any other mods you might have to patch the files that both mine and the other use.

If you want me to make a patch for something cool or you did one yourself, then I might be able to put that in the next mod release.

Directions:
	
	1.  Move the contents of the raw folder in this zip to the dwarf fortress folder raw. 
	
	2a. If you want to use my ascii tileset then move Uncle_Spams_32x32.png to ./data/art
	
	2b. Then change these lines in ./data/init/init.txt
	    [FONT:X] and [FULLFONT:X] (X = old tileset)
	    to
	    [FONT:Uncle_Spams_32x32.png] and [FULLFONT:Uncle_Spams_32x32.png]
