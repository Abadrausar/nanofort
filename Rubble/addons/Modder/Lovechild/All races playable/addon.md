==All Races Playable Mod==
The goal of this mod is simple: To let you play Fortress mode and Adventure mode with as many races as possible, while adding or changing as little as possible. You can play Fortress mode as dwarves, elves, humans, or goblins. You can play Adventure mode as a dwarf, elf, human, goblin, kobold, or an animalman from above or below ground. A few basic adventurer crafting reactions have been added to make it easier to play as an outsider.

3. About the races

1. Installation 
-With Rubble

You click in the corresponding case in the ruble Web interface ;)

-Without rubble

Drag the original raw folder of the mod into your main DF folder. This will cause the original 
creature_standard, creature_subterranean, entity_default, and item_weapon files to be 
overwritten. This mod has not been tested for compatibility with other mods, but should work 
alongside any mod that doesn't itself change the creature_standard, creature_subterranean, 
entity_default and item_weapon files.

2. Embarking

When choosing where to embark in Fortress Mode, it is not immediately obvious which race you 
are embarking as. Go to the Neighbors tab, and the currently selected race will be first on 
the list. To switch race you need to go to the Civilization tab and choose another 
civilization; go between the two tabs until you find the race you want.

3. About the races

-Dwarves

These are the dwarves you know and love. They have access to steel, the strongest metal in 
the game (or is it?) and underground plants, but they require alcohol to get through the 
working day. Dwarves may occasionally be taken by strange moods and produce wondrous 
artifacts.

-Elves

The elves are very different from the other races. They do not mine, cut down trees, or farm; 
instead they rely entirely on herbalism. Elves can grow wooden logs from seeds at the 
Craftsman's Workshop, and use these for anything they need to build or craft. Elves can keep 
just about any animals as pets; make sure to bring some interesting ones when you embark. 

-Humans

Humans are the race most similar to the dwarves, but they can't make steel and grow their 
plants above ground. They are also not dependant on alcohol, and a few wells will be enough 
to keep them happy and productive.

-Goblins

Goblins do not need to eat or drink, so no food industry is necessary in a goblin pit. They 
know nothing about alloys, and can't produce anything but base metals. But they have access 
to evil animals, which include many ferocious monsters such as trolls and nightwings.
