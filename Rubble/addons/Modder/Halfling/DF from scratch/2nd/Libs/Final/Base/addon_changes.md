* Fixed two bugs that didn't allow animal skins to be tanned. Any creatures using my PLAN_MATERIALS_CER body detail plan can be tanned for their hides now. ~ Cerapter 2014 august 11
  ! Basically, don't forget to include a material with the name LEATHER.

  * New building.
  * New item.
  ! These actually don't affect the Chirps, bar the entity modifications.
+ BIG UPDATE: ~ Cerapter 2014 august 19
  + Added the Oyl. Currently unplayable, will live for a few years in worldgen, though.
  * Changed the Chirps to only use wood weapons and armour. This shouldn't stop you from making metal ones, though.
  * Fixed a bug that didn't allow Moles to spawn. Didn't notice this before.
    Anyway, Moles can now spawn and will live for a few years in worldgen.
  * Fixed some of the Oyls' reactions. Still have no idea if they work or not. I think no, though.
  + Added a new gait for anything that flows. They use the same speed everywhere.
    ! Can be seen in the Oyls' creature file.
* Cleaned up the Armory, it should work now - Buggy 9/24/14
! Set the Shadowwalkers permenantly on fire - Buggy 9/25/14
+ added sleeper creature, and entity (along with some genetically enhanced materials) Race of Adventure playable outsiders
+ Made sleeper eye colors work correctly
+ added Intergalactic Standard (my own bastardized version of Cityspeak [created using DFlang]) which is spoken by sleeper outisders (in preparation for more races)
+ fixed up my language a little bit and possibly fixed the sleeper's bleeding problem by putting arteries in their throats (weak point)
+added the awakened civilization (seems balanced, and besides their lack of clothes and weapons [help wanted] they work as they are meant to) 
 *  also added a tan hide adv mode reaction so that you can craft backpacks etc.
 *  more descriptions for sleepers and awakened
 *  gave sleepers "directions" which should make playing them alot more immersive and fun (in the process of testing this out)
+ Added the ag-yag, this world's clay. ~ Cerapter 2014 sept 16
 ! Ag-yag is totally not a modification of the word "agyag" which totally does not mean "clay". Totally.
