BTW, is this "keeping everyone informed of everything I'm doing/modding step by step" thing cool, or is it just annoying?
Well, why wouldn't you? But remember to go by the rules, this is extremely important or the world will get cluttered with clashing and crashing mods. If you're going to define a body like "humanoid", you must name it eg. HUMANOID_BFE after yourself so that if someone else also makes a (different) body named humanoid, it doesn't cause problems. You probably get it already, just saying.

Also, are my files still looking crazy?

# Quick and (very) dirty guide to playing the halflings in the first and minimal world, compared to vanilla dwarves:

Basics:

- Do not use "just play". That's a terrible idea. It's designed for dwarves. Design your embark carefully. Don't take booze. What you need is LOTS of seeds, wood, and hatchets if you're lazy. Having a herbalist and a grower is good for your survival.

- You do not need alcohol, nor can you make it in the minimal world. You must have fresh water to drink at all times. Settling next to a river is the smart thing to do. In newer additions to DF from scratch you can brew alcohol and use it as a source of drink, but beware - it can give halflings hangovers leading to nausea.

- To dig, you must first make a shovel. This takes a special reaction called "make wooden shovel" and consumes 1 wood. It is available at the craftsman's workshop. The relevant skill is wood crafting. It is used similarly to a metal pick. It's not available at embark due to DF's restrictions about items.

- You can make your default equipment at the carpenter's from wood similarly to how dwarves make training equipment, except bows are made at a bowyer's shop and arrows at a craftsman's. You can also make all equipment out of metal, and bows and arrows from bone. If any of these reactions are not visible, re-download - they were accidentally unavailable for a while.

- In the minimal world, you have only above ground crops. You have two options: pumpkins and flax. Flax can be made into (pricey) flax cloth and the seeds can be eaten when cooked. Pumpkins produce a lot of food and nothing else, except seeds after being eaten. Flax can be grown in spring and summer. Pumpkin grows in spring, summer, autumn. NOTHING grows in winter, beware. -- If you are playing with later additions to the mod, you will have other plants to farm. Hobbits can grow things underground as well.

- Plants now take a realistic time to grow. You must plant crops at the start of a season to harvest them at its end. Plant yields are more abundant to compensate.

- Halflings and their pets clean themselves of contaminants automatically once per day to preserve frame rate. This does not need water, nor does it take a job.

- Halflings can and will throw hard rocks at anything they consider threatening. No item is needed, but the halfling must have at least one hand.. The range is 20 squares. These can do some damage. They also have a creature variation that allows them to occasionally do higher-damage roundhouse kicks when fighting with fists, but are still generally squishy in melee.

- Halflings DO need to wear shoes. This is a problem because they couldn't make shoes until bugfix 2. As above, re-download mod to get newest version if issue

Digging and working metal:

- Halflings do not get any metal items during worldgen, but can still work metal in theory. This is very significant because DF requires items that are used for digging to be made out of metal, as well as anvils.

- You can therefore never usually not - sometimes halflings will randomly have access to metals to make shovels but mostly not as of the latest version never embark with digging equipment, even though you can improve mining skill. To dig, you must first make a wooden shovel (see basics).

- As halfling, you can never embark with an anvil in the minimal world. You can trade for one later after there is someone else to trade with, but you can also make one yourself. Halflings, shockingly, have figured out something dwarves never could: metal items can be made by non-forging methods without anvils. Currently you can only make anvils by this method. You must first process metal into bars at a smelter, and you must have fuel (halflings can never use magma). Then you can use the "cast crude anvil" to melt those metal bars into anvil shape. After you have an anvil, you can work metals normally and make your normal equipment out of metal.

- If playing a later version, since laularukymo's turn, you are able to embark with an expensive iridium anvil if you want to. There's no benefit to this over a cast crude anvil.

- You have five items of equipment in the minimal world (labeled as "small"): cudgels, hatchets, shovels, bucklers and short bows. These are worse than human-sized equipment, but you'll have to make do. There are only two items of clothing in the minimal world: dress shirts and short pants. This is bad, considering there are beasts in this world. UPDATE: as of Putnam's turn, you now can make leather armor. The pieces are: one of two types of hats, one of two types of coat, gloves, and if you're lucky (it's uncommon but possible halflings can make them) leather boots. These are superior to vanilla leather armor.

Government:

- Halflings start with a mayor. This is a settlement, not an expedition. Mayor demands are lower than for dwarves, in particular halflings never want armor stands or weapon racks. There is no other form of government - you will never see a baron or a monarch.

- You may appoint doctors, record keepers, managers, military commanders and traders at the nobles screen. You may appoint and later remove as many of each as you need. They all need an office once appointed.

- To use military, military commanders must be appointed first as nobles, then squads can be assigned in the military screen. The mayor can lead one squad himself.

- Halflings have some natural skill in sneaking and growing, and learn these skills faster than vanilla dwarves. Depending on your preferences, this may mean they come with the hunting and growing labors enabled by default and those may be disabled as needed.

Survival:

- You are small. Very small, and this affects a lot of things. The way size works in DF, a mallard can occasionally kill a halfling - and your hounds are larger than you are. 

- To make matters worse, halflings have a "realistic" body plan with connecting ankles, knees, wrists, bony spine, and major arteries in the throat and organs.

- You have bad equipment and your unique smoking pipes don't (yet?) help you survive. Avoid melee if possible. Use your bows and use your hounds.

- Prepare in advance. You can't grow crops fast to compensate for bad planning. Herbalism helps a lot, because unless other plants are added to the world, wild flax and pumpkin are ridiculously common.

- This is meant to be a challenging (but still usable) race, more faithful to an idea than easy to play. More user-friendly races like dwarves will come later. On the other hand, the unique abilities and more effective government do have their advantages. One major downside to the current world is that without a hostile civilization, all your 'fun" is going to come in one big package very late game, and 'til then it's just farming pumpkins.

# Formics: An Introductory Course

Well, first things first: Formics are a caste-based society that is modeled on ant hives. They are divided into four castes, which I'll get into in a second, but one of the most important things to remember is this: don't get attached to the buggers. The vast majority of them will not see their eighth* birthday.

Two other important differences from Halflings and the mythical dwarves: they do not sleep, and they have exoskeletons. Their chitinous exteriors make them far more durable than only-flesh-and-bone softskins could be, but due to the rather violent and equally chitinous nature of much of the fauna they need this advantage just to be able to go toe-to-tarsus in battle. Their lack of sleep means you will never need to build a bed outside of a hospital - the tyranny of the Third Migration Wave is over! No more rush to build a giant dormitory or (oh God why) individual bedrooms for the new migrants; they wouldn't appreciate it even if you did. This does, however, come with drawbacks.

The Caste System

Workers
These are the bedrock of Formic society, and of Formic colonies that you found. They are by far the most numerous, but also a bit dim-witted - they learn all skills except fishing, farming, mining, and wood cutting at 60% efficiency. At fishing, farming, mining, and wood cutting, they improve their skills 20% faster, though - and they'll need all that speed, because they'll keel over at the ripe old age of 5. They are literally born ready to work, though, or very nearly so, so any domestically produced workers will provide more use than immigrants. Their tiles flash between 'A' and 'w', to help pick them out of a crowd.

Soldiers
Born shock troops, Formic soldiers are bigger than any other caste save the Queens. They learn Formic-related combat skills faster (spear, sword, dodging, shield, and fighting), but where they really shine is their ability to enter martial trances. The also feel no fear, and so will fight to the death to defend the hive. As a downside, they have 3 years of useless resource sucking before being able to take up a scimitar; they do, however, live longer than the workers - up to 12 years if you're lucky, allowing them time to earn some experience and train the next generation. Their tiles flash from 'A' to 's'.

For those poor softskin-players whose Halflings start at war with the Formics, take note that Formic Soldiers are trapavoid. Have fun with that :)

Drones
Drones are there for breeding. That is basically all they should be used for - producing babbies, and artisan jobs that workers have trouble grasping. They have neither skill bonuses nor maluses, and are larger than the average worker (not quite soldier-size); they also live for up to thirty years. Most importantly, they are exceptionally rare - 150 times less likely to be born than workers, and 50 times less likely than a soldier - and thus should be protected almost as well as a Queen. Whatever you do, don't send these guys to the front lines against the spider-centaurs - not unless you have backups. If you only have one, send a legendary miner worker to battle ahead of him, for the Queen's sake. Workers are expendable. Drones, less so.

Queens
The immortal female caste of the Formics. They are incredibly rare - 1500 times less likely than a worker! - and incredibly valuable. A single queen is not picky about what male she mates with (no husbands!), and can produce as many as 8 nymphs at once. If you get a Queen, protect her - keep her in a well-provisioned chamber deep under a mountain, with a labyrinth of atom smashers between her and potential threats, or something similarly thorough, because in all likelihood if she dies you will never see another. If you have a queen, workers are basically expendable, and a single Queen and Drone together could theoretically repopulate an entire hive after some kind of magma-related apocalypse, though how that would happen I'm not sure, since I don't think we have any magma-safe materials to make a pump stack out of.

Queens are the largest caste of Formics as well, so their size should provide some measure of defense against the average home invader, but I recommend not ever letting it become a factor.

The Nobility
Allets
Formic word for "chief". This is an expedition leader. He is your broker and that guy who meets with dissatisfied workers and such, as well as judge and jury in the Hive in the Everqueen's name.

Ashalim
...and this guy is your executioner. None of those sissy dwarven hammerings, either - just a sharpened scimitar to cut down any fool worker who decided to disobey his superior. Additionally he fills the role of militia commander, and leads the as-scuteri squad in defense of the hive.

Scribe
A combination manager/record keeper, of whom you can have three.

Mesarthim
The Ashalim's subordinates, in charge of mes-scuteri squads (basically, the militia, though thanks to the biological caste system this holds a bit more weight than it does among softskins)

Chirurgeon General
Chief medical formic. Not much else to say.

Regent
The chief representative of the Everqueen in each settlement. Properly, a drone, though often a member of a lower caste if they prove capable. They expect rather odd quarters for Formics, but then, folks in power tend to be a bit eccentric, right? In any case, they'd very much like a bedroom, and some other rooms. They can impose demands and mandates, too, so you'll have those to deal with.

The Everqueen
The immortal goddess-queen herself. Always a member of the Queen caste, and if she ever shows up at your fortress I had no part in it because I haven't a clue how to properly work monarch-arrival thing, if it's even possible. If she does, though, hey - free Queen!

On Alcohol

Insects are not immune to drunkenness, sadly. While Honeywine is safer than water reservoirs due to its inability to be contaminated with lovely syndromes, Formics will get drunk off of it as well. Like with haflings, it's a good idea to maintain some form of safe water cistern for drinking purposes.

*eighth is perhaps the single most awkward word in english to spell, which I realized when typing.


# Lizardfolk Play Guide (Not Finished!)

-Get rid of the anvil.  The Lizardfolk have their own custom type of forge that does not need the anvil.

-Smithing is entirely tied to the 'Woodburner' profession.  This is necessary in order to have a limit to the number of metals that they have the ability to utilize.

-Don't bother with getting plants, the Lizardfolk race is entirely carnivorous.  Instead, get a decent amount of tamed animals.  Preferably not dragons, they won't eat anything that has scales.

-All of the other races are hostile, due to the child snatching tag on the Lizardfolk.  In universe, this was intended to represent the fact that  other races use the Lizardfolk as warriors, and the Dragonkin take Lizardfolk to use their magic upon the Lizardfolk to turn them into more Dragonkin.

-Lizardfolk nobility is an evolving system.  If you are less than a certain population, then they are named one way, but after that population is reached, then they gain new names.

-Lizardfolk do not build up walls.  The most that they build in terms of defenses is the occasional barricade in the marshes.  (Note: they are an aboveground race.)

-A word to authors: Lizardfolk do not believe in the concept of good and evil.  The closest they come is the concepts of chaos and order.
