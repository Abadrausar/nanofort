# Haiku Extreme: Arghhh Abomination!!!"
This is DF with the minimal number of active objects to have *all* the basics of a functional game.
# What we have until now is:
1. 4 versatile Creatures: 1 wagon,1 vermin colonies (amphibious fishable ubiquitous), 1 domestics (a kill vermin wagon puller) 1 civilized (dwarves into 2 separated entities) and nothing more. For the variety you have the titans, FB semiFB, night creatures and rest of random.
2. 34 Inorganics: 5 to enable adventure coins, 6 for the bronze line, 5 for the steel line, 3 for the deep specials, and 15 for the rest: stones and ores.(This one could be object of further simplification)
3. 3 multiuse Plants: 1 grass (subterranean and above ground) , 1 crop (subterranean and above ground), 1 tree (subterranean and above ground). 
4. That makes a great total of 41 active vanilla objects to play with only 6 modified from vanilla base, nothing more (this is not strictly true) nothing less; AND HEY!, before you begin to protest, remember that this is a minimal mod done in the interest of SCIENCE and exploration, it could be FUN to play or not (it is up to you to see and decide), but this is not certainly the unique objective of this mod not even the primary.

The number of active objects have been already dramatically reduced (good news for your FPS) but I think that it could be reduced even further (even less inorganics...), some more SCIENCE required... When you experiment trying to remove even more objects you will find some of the hard limits of the game.

# Some of those hard limits already more or less identified:
1. It seems that you must have at least two entities defined to elude world generation rejects.
2. A wagon creature must be define in order to be able to start the game in fort mode.
3. You need at least the vanilla base language files and then the specifics language files of the creature of your civilization if those creatures are able to speak.
4. BODY, BODY_DETAIL_PLAN, BOOK, BUILDING, DESCRIPTOR_COLOR, DESCRIPTOR_PATTERN, DESCRIPTOR_SHAPE, INTERACTION, ITEM, MATERIAL_TEMPLATE, REACTION, SECRET and TISSUE_TEMPLATE have not been investigated for pruning.
