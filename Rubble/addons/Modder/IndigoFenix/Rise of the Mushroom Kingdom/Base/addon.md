Burly Koopas are twice the size of a regular Koopa, but tend to tire out quickly.  All except Magikoopas can curl up inside their armor for protection when in danger.  Their civs have access to good weapons and armor as well.
4. Shyguys: Subpar stats initially, but they train skills much faster than other races.  They also have good agility.
5. Beans: Small and weak overall, but can enter combat trances and grow stronger when injured, and have good starting equipment
6. Bumpties: Weak offensively, high resistance against blunt damage, can slide to move in a straight line without tiring out
7. Bub-ulbs: Can live on water alone, stronger when aboveground, drowsiness-inducing pollen attack, can sense plant-based creatures
8. Mole People: When underground, can sense creatures long-distance and get stat boosts
9. Frog People: Natural swimmers, mildly poisonous spit and sweat, slow top speed but can move at top speed without buildup
10. Doogans: Natural appraisal skills, good sense of smell
11. Craws: Natural tracking skills, can fly

19. Kongs: Naturally fast climbers, come in three sizes
20. Kremlings: Tough skin, come in three sizes



# Fortress Mode:
1.	Toads: Domestic production and trade-oriented gameplay.  Cook ordinary crops into valuable meals, or combine them together for new surprises.  Raise Yoshis for defensive purposes.  Build warp pipes to gather resources and seek out special missions.  Collect power stars to gain special game-changing powers - revive your fallen comrades, summon earthquakes or meteor showers against enemies, and shine a light into the depths of the Underworld.  Must live above-ground.
2.	Koopas: Noble-oriented defensive game.  Build a powerful miltary and defend your fortress against hordes of foes.  Raise powerful monsters as pets.  Use magma-based alchemy to transmute metals, mutate into stronger forms, polymorph your enemies, and gain the favor of your civilization's leader.
3.	Shyguys: For challenge-seekers and megaproject lovers.  Grow from a disorganized rabble into a functional settlement.  Open up portals to subspace, create imaginary blocks from nothing and build to your heart's content.  Play the slots for random surprises.  Set out clever traps for your enemies, then hide in your fortress and watch the fireworks.




# Toads (Homo boletus):
##	Outline: 

>	Also known as the Mushroom Folk, the diminutive, fungus-like Toads are the most prominent civilization in the Mushroom World.  These little people are of a peaceful sort who prefer to live off the land, cooking fabulous meals from the magical plants that grow in their soil and trading with the numerous other races they share their world with.  Toads make friends easily and can be found almost anywhere in the world, although they prefer to build their main towns around temperate forests.
>	As the leader of a Toad settlement, you will have access to 'Warp Pipe' technology, allowing your citizens to connect to distant lands by way of a vast interdimensional network and collect raw resources that might not be available on your embark site.  You will run services for people in faraway kingdoms and earn 'shining coins', to exchange for Power Stars.  After collecting enough Stars, you will be able to call upon phenomenal cosmic powers to defend your settlers.  Are you ready?

##	Physical Characteristics: 

>	Toads are small creatures posessing a strange amalgam of human and fungal characteristics.   Their humanoid shape, brain, heart, lungs, and what seems to be a fragile vestigial skeleton suggest a human origin, but their bodies are saturated with an omnipresent fungus that has taken over most of their vital functions.  In the place of blood, a kind of raw life-force, or 'vim', flows through their veins, which has numerous unusual properties of its own.  In addition to a normal brain, Toads have a mushroom-like spore-filled hymenium which extends outside of their skull, making them especially vulnerable to wrestlers.
>	The conflict between the human and mushroom aspects of their biology causes Toads to suffer a number of unusual ailments.  Spending too much time below ground can cause the fungus to overgrow parts of their brain, causing chronic dizziness that lasts until they return to the surface.  Although Toads can venture below ground to collect stone, water, or other resources, you will have to build your main settlement on the surface or endure the penalties.
>	Most standard poisons and venomous bites or stings have no effect on Toads, but extreme levels of sudden stress can result in a coma-like condition known as 'shroomshock'.  Toads are also subject to a couple of unique diseases, such as 'the blorbs', a full-body swelling transmitted by a rare mushroom.
>	Despite all of their handicaps, the diminutive Toads are surprisingly quick and strong, and they have amazing recuperative abilities, able to heal broken bones and most serious wounds with nothing more than a bit of rest.  In combat, they rely on their great agility to stay out of reach.  However, because their fungus-like anatomy is fragile and sensitive to pain, Toads aren't really the best fighters.  They are quite good at moving things around, though - a team of Toads working together can throw up an above-ground shelter in a fraction of the time it would take other creatures to do the same.

##	Personality and Behavior:

>	Toads are optimistic, but rather sensitive to tragedy.  They love their nobles and will get good thoughts when talking to them.  When embarking to a new site, a team of Toads will elect one among them to serve as the 'designated hero', who will give the others a huge boost in happiness right from the start and encourage them to work quickly.  They will put up with a general lack of comfort early on, at least until someone dies.  Because of their social nature, a single death can cause quite a shock in your settlement.  Make sure to keep your citizens safe!
>	Toads rarely get angry, so even in the worst of times you usually won't have to worry much about destructive tantrums or murderous berserkers.  Even their ghosts tend to be the quietly haunting type, so recovering a fortress from a disaster is generally easier for Toads than for other races.

#	Yoshis:

>	Since Toads are not great fighters, they often travel around with pet Yoshis to guard them.  Yoshis are large creatures who are more than capable of fending off wild animals and low-level invaders.  They can also throw eggs to attack from a distance.  There is a disadvantage to relying on Yoshis for hunting, though: they have a habit of devouring their victims whole, preventing you from collecting their meat, skin, and coins.  They will leave behind any weapons or armor though.
>	Yoshis need to eat and drink to survive.  They will eat from stockpiles just like your regular citizens, but will need an open water source to drink from.  A murky pool will suffice in a pinch, but if you embark on a desert or glacier, you'll have to either venture into the caverns or quickly create an artificial pool via warp pipe.
>	Both male and female Yoshis produce eggs, though only the female eggs can hatch.  Be aware that Yoshis can multiply rather quickly, producing an average of 3 eggs per clutch, so you might want to limit their growth unless you have enough food to feed them all.  If you absolutely must, you can slaughter and eat Yoshis, but since Yoshis are sentient and capable of making friends, doing so will give your Toads bad thoughts, so this should only be done as a last resort.

##	Kitchen Guide

>	Toads have access to several special reactions in the kitchen for cooking foods into more powerful forms.  While you have only limited control over the kinds of foods used in these reactions, it isn't a bad idea to try combining foods if you have a surplus.  In addition to granting powerups, these special foods often make decent trade goods.

##	Warp Pipes

>	The mysterious vim that flows in the bodies of the Toads has a surprising mystical quality to it.  When concentrated and refined, it acquires the power to warp the fabric of space itself.  This miraculous substance has been used as the basis for creating the coveted green metal used in warp pipe technology, and is produced through a secret that has been carefully guarded by the Toad race, because it would be terrible if, say, some maruding aliens found out about it and started harvesting Toads to power their spaceships' warp drives.
>	To produce a warp pipe, you will need several barrels of alchohol, 5 empty jars, and a Toad to extract fresh vim.  The reactions take place at a still and can be hazardous if not done carefully - draining too much vim from a single Toad can prove fatal.  If your brewer grows faint or pale, let them rest for a while and designate a different Toad to produce your next batch.
>	Once you have five jars of vim, these must be refined to create a single jar of 'azoth', which can then be used to treat a pipe section at a Crafttoad's Workshop.  It takes 2 warp pipe sections to create a warp pipe, but once you create one, it can easily be dismantled and reconstructed to create a pipe leading elsewhere.
>	There are eight different kinds of warp pipes, seven which can produce free raw materials, and one which has an entirely different purpose which will be essential for collecting coins.

1.	Green Grassland: Produce free food.
2.	Sandy Desert: Produce unlimited sand (requires a bag to hold the sand).
3.	Water World: Once this pipe is constructed, Toads will automatically use it to fill any empty buckets lying around.  Build one and designate a pond zone nearby to quickly create a standing pool that Yoshis can drink from.
4.	Wood Forest: Produce free wood.  This is slower than cutting down trees, but it can help if you embark in a biome without enough trees.
5.	Stone Mines: Produce free stone.  This is slower than mining, but very useful if you embark on an aquifier, and you don't have to worry about your miners running into problems from spending too much time underground.
6.	Ice Zone: Quickly produce unlimited ice.  This will only work properly in freezing temperatures, otherwise the ice will melt the moment it is produced.
7.	Fire Sea: Quickly produce unlimited obsidian.  This can be hazardous: it will frequently let out a burst of superheated mist, which will scald your worker and can set them on fire if you aren't careful.
8.	The Market: Allows you to obtain and complete special requests to earn coins.

##	Completing Requests

>	Aside from the normal method of slaughtering monsters, Toads can earn shining coins by completing requests using a warp pipe to the Market.
1.	Step 1: Use a screw press to process wood into blank paper (using the plant processing labor).
2.	Step 2: Create a 'Requests Office' and write out a flyer.  This is a ten-step automatic process, so it will take longer than most jobs, but you can ignore it once it's selected.  Note that if you try and produce multiple flyers at once, the job will be spread out over all of them, making each one take longer to finish but then completing them all at once.
3.	Step 3: Once you have a flyer, take it to the Warp Pipe to the Market and post it to obtain one or more requests.  Requests will ask for a number of specific items, which can be pretty much anything - constructed items, cooked food, specific kinds of vermin, and more.
4.	Step 4: Sort through your requests, decide which ones you want to accept, forbid the others, then select the 'sign requests' task at the Requests Office.  Forbidding requests will prevent you from accidentially shipping off important items like food or weapons before you're ready.
5.	Step 5: Once you have produced the required items, your Toads will automatically take the items along with the signed request to the warp pipe and ship them off, netting you a reward, usually a number of coins.

##	The Star Beacon

>	The final building Toads can produce is the Star Beacon, an altar that allows them to call upon the power of the Stars themselves.  To use the Star Beacon, you will need to collect Power Stars by offering up 100 shining coins.  If you're lucky enough to embark in a location containing buried Star Pieces, you can also obtain stars by digging up 5 of them.
>	Using the Star Beacon will not destroy your Power Stars, but it will cause them to shatter into Star Pieces which must then be reconstructed before you can use them again.  The more Stars you collect, the more powerful abilities you will be able to use.  Once you collect 21 Power Stars, you will be able to fuse them into a Grand Star to unlock even more powerful abilities.



# Koopas (Homo chelyformes):
##	Outline

>	Living in ominous dark fortresses scattered across the surface of the world, the Turtle People have a long history of sealing themselves off from the outside.  Long ago, it is believed by some, the forerunners of their civilization made a bargain with a demon, exchanging their human forms for the secrets of alchemy and long life.  While not actually evil, they do have a bad habit of kidnapping children that they fear would otherwise rise up and attack them.  Not surprisingly, this often results in a self-fulfilling prophecy, and Koopas tend to make enemies quickly.  The tendency for bloodthirsty demons to set themselves up as Koopa leaders probably doesn't help either.
>	As the leader of a Koopa Fortress, you will delve into the depths of the earth and gain access to the secrets of alchemy, learning to transmute metals, augment the bodies of your citizens, and even create life itself from fire and gold.  Build your fortress and gain the attention and admiration of your civilization's king - and the ire of your jealous foes.  Fortunately, Koopas are stronger than most of the beings who hate them.  Let the slaughter begin.

##	Physical Characteristics

>	Covered in scales, fairly large in comparison to most races, and generally long-lived, Koopas are a tough race, if a bit on the slow side.  They are not born with shells, but a Koopa isn't considered complete until they claim one.  When startled, a Koopa's first instinct is not to run, but to curl up in a defensive ball, protecting their extremities.  Depending on what the Koopa is wearing on its upper body and what weapon their attacker is wielding, this may either prove quickly fatal or make the Koopa nearly indestructable.
>	Once curled up, a Koopa will not come out until the threat is removed, even if given a command in the squad menu.  They can last quite a while against most animals, so you'll generally have a chance to rescue them.
>	Koopas reproduce by laying eggs, so you will need nest boxes to produce children... or you can simply fry them up if you're low on food.  They have a gender ratio somewhat skewed toward males.
>	Koopas have an interesting relationship with caves: living underground for a few months will cause their skill levels to decline, but after spending enough time in the dark to become fully cave-adapted, they will become much stronger than their above-ground counterparts.
>	The latent magic flowing in the blood of Koopas has accelerated their evolution and occasionally becomes manifest in a natural birth.  As a result, Koopas have several different castes.  Aside from the baseline Koopa, the other castes are somewhat rare, but it is possible to trigger a mutation into one of the other castes using magic potions.

1.	Normal: These are your basic workers and soldiers.  Slow and steady, their toughness and endurance is greater than that of other castes.
2.	Parakoopa: These Koopas have wings and can fly.  They are more agile but less tough than the baseline Koopa.  Other than that, there isn't much to say about them.  Due to pathing issues they aren't as useful as they should be in Fortress mode (they will only fly to areas that they could get to by walking), but depending on the shape of your fortress they might be able to take shortcuts, speeding up construction projects or hauling tasks.  Be aware that Parakoopas will occasionally get stuck due to pathing glitches.  They occur in about 1 out of 5 natural births, and a regular Koopa can acquire wings by drinking a Potion of Winged Courage.
3.	Burly Koopas: These buff turtles are nearly twice the height and width of your garden-variety Koopa.  They are ridiculously strong, capable of fighting off entire groups of enemies, and can even wield large weapons that smaller Koopas won't be able to handle.  They are also prone to rage in combat.  However, they are on the slow side, and are not very good at menial labor.  Only about 1 out of 100 Koopas are born giants, but it is possible to supersize a regular Koopa using a Potion of Brute Power.
4.	Magikoopa: Magic flows through the blood of these rare Koopas.  They are able to damage enemies from a distance using magic, and can even polymorph their foes into (hopefully) weaker forms.  They are unable or unwilling to curl up in defense like other Koopas, but will teleport away when in danger instead.  Their physical stats are lower than that of their peers.  Only about 1 out of 100 Koopas are naturally inclined toward magic, but it is possible to transform a regular Koopa into a Magikoopa using a Potion of Arcane Wisdom.
5.	Dry Bones: Technically not a regular caste, as they (practically) never occur in a natural birth, but you can play as one in Adventure Mode or convert a regular Koopa into one using a Potion of Undeath.  These skeletal creatures are not intelligent and cannot be assigned labors, but they will continue to ceaselessly perform whatever actions they were doing at the time of conversion, never eating, sleeping, or getting upset.  You can also pasture them to serve as guards: although they aren't great fighters, they are quite hard to kill and will serve as a useful distraction in order to buy the rest of your fortress time to prepare.  Magikoopas can also revive them if they are 'killed'.

##	Personality and Behavior

>	Koopas are survivors.  What they lack in energy and enthusiasm, they make up for with patience, mental fortitude,  memory, and respect for tradition.  They might grumble at or about their superiors when annoyed, but in the end, they have a great deal of loyalty and honor for the chain of command structure their civilization is built upon.  They like fighting as well, and will get good thoughts when slaughtering their enemies.

##	Koopa Pets and Allies

>	Koopas can raise many unique pets which can be very useful for defense, especially for a beginning fortress.  Many of them have specific uses and unique behaviors, some of which can prove hazardous if not handled properly.  Make sure to know them well!

1.	Shellcreepers: These dog-sized turtles are the basic Koopa pets.  They can be trained for war and lay eggs.  When in danger, they tend to hide in their shells.  This makes it tough for unarmed creatures to kill them.  Koopas have a long history with Shellcreepers and their relatives - many of their early wars were fought primarially with trained Shellcreepers, to the effect that some people mistakenly believe that they and the Koopas themselves are the same species.
2.	Parashellcreepers: Winged variants of the basic Shellcreeper.  They can fly - other than that, they are effectively the same.
3.	Spinies: Using their spiked shells to attack, these Shellcreeper relatives have a higher attack potential than their smooth-shelled counterparts.  Their spikes can also be used to decorate objects.
4.	Buzzy Beetles: These hardy turtles have shells made of solid bronze.  They are especially tough to kill without strong weapons and make useful guards to station in the caverns.  Koopas can also melt their shells in a smelter to produce 2 bronze bars per beetle, making them a useful renewable source of weapon-grade metals on maps that lack them.
5.	Goombas: These small, mushroom-like creatures are civilized allies of the Koopas as well as serving them directly as soldiers.  As intelligent 'pets', they require food and an open water source to survive - a murky pool will suffice if nothing better is available.  They multiply fairly quickly and make good cannon fodder, provided you have enough food to take care of them.  Keeping them underground for about a year and a half will cause them to grow much stronger.  You can also butcher them for coins, but be warned that this will cause bad thoughts.
6.	Bob-ombs: Sentient bombs with gunpowder for blood, these creatures are prone to exploding at the slightest provocation, so handle them carefully as friendly fire is very possible.  Pasturing them outside as siege bait is probably the best use for them, but remember that they need access to food and standing water to survive.
7.	Spikes: One of the larger creatures used by Koopas, these hulking, bipedal reptiles are sometimes thought to be one of the earliest successes of Koopa alchemy.  They are strong, loyal, and capable of speech and learning, if somewhat slow-witted.  Their most remarkable feature is their ability to produce large iron balls from their stomachs, which they can then use as powerful, if infrequent, projectile weapons.  Like other sentient pets, they require food and standing water to raise.  They reproduce with eggs, so you'll need a nest box to raise more of them.
8.	Piranha Plants: Carnivorous plants with a complex life cycle.  Growing a garden of Piranha Plants takes time, but fortunately the dormant nipper spores from which they grow come cheap and they are low-maintanance pets overall, so embarking with 10 or so spores, sealing them in an underground nursery, and waiting for them to multiply is a viable option.  They mature into vermin-hunting Nipper Plants after about one year, which is the only time in their life that they will breed, then take root and mature into fully-grown Piranha Plants about one season later, at which point they will give birth for the first and only time in their life.  They are immobile when mature, but can grow quite large and make useful perimeter guards.  Use pastures to place them where you want them.  Some plants may also be able to develop special abilities by eating certain special insects during the nipper plant phase.
9.	Lakitu's Clouds: These soft, fluffy, flying animals are the primary mount for Koopas, although they aren't very effective in combat.  Despite their cloud-like appearance, they are actually made up of a dense thread-like tissue, the outer layers of which can be extracted, sheared, and woven into cloth.  Lakitu's Cloud fluff is not great as armor but it is very lightweight and makes good insulation.
10	Chomps: By far the most powerful of the Koopas' pets, and one of the strongest creatures in the game.  These monsters have a shell of solid iron and a mouthful of teeth capable of piercing the skull of most megabeasts - few individual creatures can stand against them for long.  But be warned: Chomps have a volitile temper and can never truly be tamed.  Even the most docile of these creatures are prone to lashing out at random every once in a while, so allowing Chomps to run around your densely populated areas is likely to result in accidental deaths.  Keeping them pastured out in the open with lots of space to run away is generally safe, or you could go the traditional method and chain them up in your dungeons.  A free-roaming Chomp isn't quite as perfect a defense against sieges as you might think, either: they tire easily, especially when attacked by multiple enemies at once, and steel spears or pikes can penetrate their shell.  If you choose to butcher them, Koopas can melt down their shells into quite a fair amount of iron.
11.	Stone Chomps: The 'discount' Chomp.  These stone-shelled creatures are produced by a lower kind of magic.  They are incapable of reproduction, and they are generally inferior to the iron-shelled variety in combat.  However, they come cheaper and will not lash out at their owners.
	
##	Alchemy Guide

>	Koopas have maintained a long relationship with the alchemical mysteries - it is thought by some that the first among them chose the turtle as a symbol for the longevity that they sought in their early days.  Their ancient writings are shrouded in mystery and metaphor, and although the legend of the Two Brothers, the Three Princesses, and the Beast has long since been adopted by the Toads and twisted into anti-Koopa propoganda, only the Koopas know the true message behind the stories and the secrets they conceal.

1.	The Elder Brother in Red - the ancient fire within the Earth.
2.	The Younger Brother in Green - the vital energy hidden in the spirits of plants, and the spirit of life that seeks the purity of the Shining Gold.  Also known as 'Azoth'.
3.	The Princess in Peach - Carmot, the Philosopher's Stone.
4.	The Princess in Gold - the Shining Gold that is the true soul of metals, called out by the Philosopher's Stone.
5.	The Princess in Blue - the unbreakable metal hidden in the deepest places, eternally pure and untouchable.
6.	The Castle - the black volcanic glass, the purest of all stones, where the Philosopher's Stone is found.
7.	The Demon - the coarse matter that seeks to bind the Princesses within its grasp and must be burned away by the Brothers to bring them forth.

>	To trap the Fire that it may be used, take two large gems to the pools of molten rock within the earth.  Use one to create a Gem Charge Point, and use the heat of the molten rock to empower the other.  This is 'the Red Brother's Journey'.  The gems can be made from any material, but large gems are rare, so it may be worthwhile to bring one with you, or purchase one from a trader.  Charging a gem will take at least a season, but the gem will remain when the fire is used, so it can be charged again.
>	Azoth is brought forth by  dissolving 10 shining gold coins in a jar of alchohol.  This is 'the Encouragement of the Green Brother'.  Shining gold can be harvested from any monster originally created through alchemy, or by purifying metal using a Philosopher's Stone.
>	To produce a Carmot Gem, the Philosopher's Stone, dissolve a boulder of volcanic glass using either Fire or Azoth.  This is 'Rescuing the Princess'.  If you lack volcanic glass, Fire or Azoth can purify any ordinary stone into it.  But not all stones contain Carmot.  You may have to search many times before you find one.  This is the meaning of 'the Princess in Another Castle'.
>	When the stone has been purified, it will become a volitile Fire Stone.  You can use it to extract strands of Fire Metal, the red metal which is eternally hot to the touch, or to dissolve it into molten rock by creating a Lava Pit.  This is 'the Burning of the Demon'.

>	When heated through Fire, Carmot contains the power to transmute metals into higher forms, from base metals to silver, from silver to gold, and from gold to the true Shining Gold, the sacred metal from which stars are made.  This is 'Inviting the Princess in Gold'.  500 Shining Coins can produce a single bar of Shining Gold.  The Princess in Gold is as hard and strong as the Princess in Blue, but while the Princess in Blue always seeks to ascend, the Princess in Gold is closer to Earth.  Thus while one is the lightest of all metals, the other is among the heaviest.

>	The Golden Elixir is born from the combined strength of the two brothers, Fire and Azoth, when Azoth is used to draw the Fire from the Gem that conceals it.  This is 'the Green Brother rescuing the Red Brother'.  It is the source of evolution and the transmutation of life itself.
>	There are four potions produced from the Golden Elixir:
1.	The Potion of Winged Courage, which grants the gift of flight.
2.	The Potion of Brute Power, which bestows great size and strength.
3.	The Potion of Arcane Wisdom, which teaches the mysteries of geometric sorcery to its drinker.
4	The Potion of Undeath, which turns the drinker into a shambling lich.

##	Magic Circle

>	Koopas can also create a Magic Circle, which is used to cast certain powerful spells.  There is a catch, though: only Magikoopas will be able to run the reactions - if anyone else tries, they will have no effect.  Casting spells at the Circle is free, but each Magikoopa must wait a length of time, which can range from a week to several months depending on the spell, before they can cast another.  There are seven main spells:
1.	Thunder Rage: Zaps all enemies on the map.  While usually non-lethal, this will stun entire armies, allowing your soldiers to gain the edge in a battle.  Recovery time: 6 months
2.	Ice Storm: Hits all enemies with a freezing blast.  This can blind, stun, or kill enemies, but if your own soldiers are too close, they might get hit as well.  Use with caution.  Recovery time: 6 months
3.	Fire Blast: Explode all foes with a blast of flame.  This will destroy most sieges in a single blow, but beware - it will start fires, and if any of your own soldiers are close, they will be hit as well.  It's best used on sieges that are far away from your fort.  Recovery time: 6 months
4.	Enrapture: Removes emotion from all Koopas for 3 months, preventing tantrums.  Use it when things get tough.  Recovery time: 6 months
5.	Supersize: Turns the nearest friendly unit into a giant (as if they had eaten a Mega Mushroom) for 1 month.  Recovery time: 3 months
6.	Dry Bones: Turns the nearest regular Koopa into a Dry Bones.  Recovery time: 3 months
7.	Reanimate Dry Bones: Reanimates the nearest dead Dry Bones unit.  Recovery time: 1 day

>	The Magic Circle can also be used to hatch Large Eggs, which can be purchased from caravans, into a monster of your choice.  Most of these have a recovery time of only a few days, but spawning a Chomp requires a recovery time of 3 months.

##	Nobility and Military

>	Koopa nobles are 'large and in charge'.  Koopas respect strength above all - they won't follow a leader that doesn't have what it takes to carry out their own wishes.  As a result, there is no 'executioner' job in Koopa culture - their leaders are responsible for making laws, enforcing those laws, and administering justice alike.  They don't use weapons in administering the death penalty, either - if you can't crush someone's skull with your bare hands, you don't deserve to be in the skull-crushing business.  Of course, since Koopa leaders are generally of the hulking Burly Koopa caste, skull-crushing is something they tend to be quite capable of, and it also means that you can't stop them by hiding away the weapons.
>	Officially, Koopa civilizations are ruled over by an absolute Monarch of the Burly Koopa caste, appointed by an Oracle of the Magikoopa caste.  In actuality, Koopa leaders are often overthrown by demons within the first few years of their reign.
>	Individual settlements are led by a mayor once they reach a reasonably-sized population.  A Koopa mayor can lead a squad of up to 200 Koopas.  While the mayor can lead the entire population into battle in case of emergency, the real reason for this is to apply a uniform (generally consisting of wooden shells) to the entire civilian population.
>	Under ordinary circumstances, Koopas require the approval of their Monarch to produce a proper military force.  When your settlement reaches a particular level of wealth and exports, you will get the opportunity to upgrade it to a Mini-Fortress, then a Castle, and finally a Keep.  These are ruled over by a Miniboss, a Boss, or a Grand Boss, respectively.  These positions can only be occupied by a Burly Koopa or a Magikoopa - if you don't have a citizen of the required caste when the outpost liasion arrives, you will have to wait another year for the chance to upgrade.  The landholder of a Koopa fort can appoint as many squads as they want - be sure to keep them safe, as it is not possible to replace a landholder once they die.
>	If you don't have a landholder yet, or your landholder has died, you can still hold together a kind of military force by appointing Brutes.  Brutes must be of the Burly Koopa caste.  They can lead a squad of 10 smaller Koopas and will raise overall morale just by being around, but they will also demand above-average lodgings, may issue mandates, and will break some heads if those mandates are not satisfied, so having too many of them around is a less-than-ideal situation.




# Shyguys (Somniatis larvatum):
##	Outline

>	Of all the inhabitants of the Mushroom World, none are more mysterious than the tiny, skittish Shyguys.  Nobody is quite sure where they came from - while they once served under the Koopas, there is evidence of their existence going back much further, in isolated pockets around the world.  Some scholars believe them to be creatures of the mind, springing from the subconscious will of the collective id.  Others argue that they originated as the fictional inhabitants of a storybook, brought to life through a forbidden spell.  And there are some who prefer the theory that they have always been around, hiding in the shadows of civilization, and the memories of their presence has impacted the dreams and tales of the other races.  Nobody can really say one way or the other, least of all the Shyguys themselves, who barely seem to remember the what happened ten minutes ago, let alone thousands of years in the past.  Living in a state of perpetual childhood, these robed, masked creatures have never managed to create a real civilization, but their unique abilities allow them to survive in a world that is hostile to their presence.
>	As the guide for a group of wandering, !!fun!!-seeking Shyguys, you'll be playing in hard mode: the Free People and the Children of Sorcery will both be gunning for you, and as one of the world's weakest and most poorly-organized races, fighting them directly won't work.  Instead, you'll have to rely on your mechanical ingenuity and creativity to survive (cage traps and siege engines are your best friends here).  But with great challenge comes great reward - as you make progress, you'll learn to enter the world of dreams and use the materials you find there to build massive, colorful megaprojects, transforming the landscape into a surreal, chromatic palace.  The world is your sandbox.  But can you survive long enough to play in it?

##	Physical Characteristics

>	Shyguys are small and quick - good at running away or hiding, but not great in straight combat.  Aside from their traditional masks and robes, they don't have much in the way of armor either.
>	These creatures are short-lived compared to other races - they attain full maturity at the age of 2 and rarely live more than 20 years.  They also tend to produce several children at once.  Increasing your fortress' population through natural reproduction is therefore a viable strategy.
>	Culturally, Shyguys are defined by their jobs.  They are very quick learners - it isn't uncommon for a Shyguy to attain legendary status in a skill after working at it for only a season or two, and a good percentage of migrants will show up with legendary ranks.  Unfortunately, they have poor memories and will lose their touch if you take them away from their job for a while.

##	Personality and Behavior

>	Shyguy ethics are quite strange by the standards of most cultures - they consider most acts acceptable as long as you have fun doing it, but they dislike all forms of authority and control.  They live their lives by the belief that 'if they don't know who you are or what you did, you didn't do it.'  They are typically thieves, stealing small items from surrounding civilizations.  The greatest crime for a Shyguy is to reveal their own face or the face of another Shyguy in public, because they believe that if their face is seen, they become punishable for their other, (usually quite numerous) crimes.  Shyguys will have extremely bad thoughts if they lose their masks, so make sure to have a few spares lying around.
>	Because of their dislike for authority, Shyguys have a very hard time getting organized.  In the early days of your fortress, you won't even be able to make a single military squad, so using traps, siege engines, and trained animals to defend yourself will be essential early on.  As your settlement grows in population and wealth, a Shyguy will be appointed as the leader, and more noble positions will open up.

## Defense Strategy

>	Shyguys have amazing mechanical skill, able to build structures and machines much more quickly and easily than other races.  It is thought by some that they are weak reality warpers, able to make physically impossible machines work simply by believing they should.  They can create wooden mechanisms in a Craft Guy's workshop, allowing you to quickly produce large numbers of traps.  Cage traps will probably be your greatest defense in the early days of your fortress, and will provide you with a large number of pets for defense or victims for whatever clever deathtrap you choose to create.
>	Shyguys are also highly creative and can easily produce paint to color worthless stones or wood in six different shades at a Coloring Workshop, which will increase their value and somehow makes them magma-safe as well. This allows Shyguys to produce magma-safe pipe sections much easier than other races can.

## Entering Subspace

>	Later in the life of your fort, you'll want to access Subspace, which lets Shyguys run a number of unique reactions by using Subcon Crystals.
>	To begin using the special Subspace reactions, you'll need to produce a Subspace Potion.  You can get one by feeding Shining Coins into a Slot Machine until you get lucky, then quickly use the Potion to produce a Subspace Portal.  The potion - and therefore, the portal - will decay over time, so you'll want to get as much out of the door as possible before it disappears.  Mostly you'll just get regular vegetables, but you'll sometimes get coins (which can be used in the Slot Machine to produce more Potions), and if you're lucky, you'll find a Subcon Crystal.
>	Subcon Crystals can be used with three different buildings: a Toy Box, which lets you produce large quantities of lightweight blocks that come in many colors, a Dream Bed, which lets you dream up large numbers of free items to temporarially increase the value of your fortress, but which will fade away over time, or a Magic Vase, which lets you search for a Key.  Keys can be used in Subspace Portals to produce more items and have a better chance at finding Subcon Crystals.  Subcon Crystals will fade away over time, so use them quickly to maximize your output.

# The Factions

## The Free People (Allies of Toads)
1.	Beans: Long-standing allies of the Toads, the laughter-loving, plant-like Beanish race dwell on the temperate grasslands.  While usually peaceful, they are overall more prepared for war than their fungal neighbors and are quick to attack invaders who encroach on their territory.  Toads will be able to purchase metal weapons and armor from them, and they will be some of the earliest challenging enemies for Koopas and Shy Guys to deal with.
2.	Bumpties: These little penguins live in the frigid polar regions.  While their meager penguin-slaps aren't much of a threat, their thick blubber protects them from most blunt attacks.  Toads will find them a welcome sight in the cold winter months, especially if you didn't prepare food.  They will often be the first invaders of a Koopa or Shy Guy fort, but they're nothing to worry about if you have a couple of sharp weapons available.
3.	Bub-ulbs: Flower creatures living in the good regions of the world, they often have some rare fruits and berries to trade.  They consider themselves to be protectors of plant life, so make sure not to trade them any wood.  They aren't much of a threat, but beware of their sleep-inducing pollen.
4.	Mole People: An industrious mining race that lives in the mountains.  They will trade mining equipment like picks and minecarts to Toads, and are in fact the simplest way for Toads to get a hold of minecarts.  They will also attack Koopas and Shy Guys, and being human-sized make somewhat tough opponents.  But their attacks have a silver lining: they fight with battle picks, which can be easily converted into regular mining picks once you kill them.
5.	Frog People: These scholarly amphibians live in the swamps.  They carry rare and expensive powerup drinks, and will show up in mid-game for trade with the Toads.  Koopas and Shy Guys shouldn't have too much trouble fighting them off despite their large size, as their only weapons are wooden staves, but watch out for their poisonous skin secretions!  Also, moats serve as no defense against them.
6.	Piantas: These hulking creatures dwell in the tropics.  Though they fight unarmed and without much in the way of armor, don't underestimate them - Piantas are brutal wrestlers, and are even stronger in the sunlight.  If you're under attack, try and lure them underground for a more balanced fight.  They will also trade tropical fruits and rare pets with Toads.
7.	Noki: These little shell-wearing folk live in the tropical oceans.  They may show up if you embark near a seashore to trade crafts made from coral and calcium carbonate.  Or, if you're playing as Koopas or Shy Guys, to attack you.  As water-dwellers, moats won't be much help against these guys; fortunately they're small so they shouldn't be too much of a problem.
8.	Doogans: A shady dog-like race specializing in trade.  Toads can pick up many useful items from them, such as plants and animals from evil regions.  They are human-sized and will be strong enemies for Koopas and Shy Guys to deal with.
9.	Craws: Crow-like people who trade in metals.  They carry spears and fly... not much more to say about them.  Toads will trade with them, Koopas and Shy Guys will have to fight them.
10.	Humans: A minority race in the Mushroom World, unaltered Homo Sapiens live in small, scattered kingdoms around the world and won't show up until late in the game.  They carry good weapons and armor, and are capable of entering combat trances.
11.	Yoshis: In addition to serving as pets for Toads, Yoshis will form small tribal clans in the tropical regions.  Toads won't be dealing with them, but Koopas and Shy Guys should be very wary about settling in Yoshi territory.  They will ambush early and often, and though they carry no weapons, their egg barrages and large size will quickly spell the end of your fort if you're not prepared.  Also, don't forget that Yoshis typically devour their kills, so don't forget to make slabs for your devoured dead after a Yoshi attack.  To determine who was eaten, check the deceased list - if it lists someone's corpse as deceased, that usually means a Yoshi ate them.

## The Children of Sorcery (allies of Koopas)
1.	Goombas: The downtrodden underlings of the Mushroom World, the tenacious Goombas live in dark fortresses in moist regions and have become well-known for their ability to tame animals.  Koopas will find them as useful trade allies, and they will be some of the early enemies for Toads and Shy Guys to deal with.  A single Goomba might not be much of a threat, but there's strength in numbers.
2.	Bob-Ombs: These walking bombs live in the dry regions.  They tend to be as volitile as you'd expect - whether you're their allies or their enemies, having them on a map can quickly result in fun of the flaming variety.  They will trade metals to Koopas - make sure you have a safe spot to keep them out of harm's way (unless you feel like using them as bait for the latest invading force).  If you're their enemy, ranged attacks are your best bet.

## The Skulking Thieves (allies of Shy Guys)
1.	Squeeks: These cute little mice are nothing to worry about.  They will trade clothing with Shy Guys and will steal from the other races, generally fleeing the moment they are spotted.
2.	Bandits: Being human sized, these larceny-loving Shy Guy relatives are a little more dangerous than the typical skulking thief.  They might also attack Toad or Koopa forts in force if they think you've got something worth stealing.  They will trade weapons (well, baseball bats) and pets with Shy Guys... and sometimes they even come with captive Yoshis!  Shy Guys who try and keep large amounts of Yoshis may be in for a surprise, though...

## Other:
1.	Kongs: Apes that live in the moist tropical forests of the world.  The Kongs come in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from small to enormous, so be sure to take a good look at their description before trying to fight one.
2.	Kremlings: Reptilian creatures living in salty marshes.  Like the Kongs, they come in a number of sizes.  Unlike the Kongs, they have sharp teeth and good weapons, though their armor is lacking.

When this happens, quickly construct a stairway up to where they are hovering, then order a solider to move to the top of the stairway and attack it.  It will drop a ? Block gem, which can be opened at the Craftman's Workshop for a prize, such as powerups or shining coins.
## Tier 2: Can be dangerous to civilians, but easy pickings for experienced soldiers.
> 		Mildly dangerous:

# Megabeasts & Night Creatures
>		Nightmares:
1.	Demon Koopa: Big, spiked shell, fire breathing, two-horned, clawed monsters.  They will try to take over Koopa civilizations if they get the chance.
2.	Gooper Blooper: Large squishy monsters with a lot of tentacles and a blinding ink attack.  These monsters don't have skulls, so aim for the head to try and score a quick kill.
3.	Giant Chomp: These enormous iron-shelled monsters are nearly impossible to kill with force alone.  Steel weapons, especially spears, are effective, and they can't swim, so if you can drop one into water that will do the trick.  If you catch one, though, it can be tamed...
3.	Mouser: These annoying rodents use explosives to attack, making them a hazard to melee fighters.  But if they use enough bombs, they will eventually start damaging themselves, making them easier to kill.
4.	Tryclyde: Three heads with multi-attack capabilities, and a fireball attack for each.  Destroying all three brains will kill it, or just aim for the heart and lungs for an easier kill.
5.	Clawgrip: Giant enemy crab.  Watch out for its rock throwing attack.
6.	King Bomb: Whoever fights this thing close-up is probably not coming back.  But unless they are strong enough to break the skin, it will never explode.
7.	Angry Sun: Just being near this blazing entity will light you on fire.  A single good hit will destroy it though.  Try projectiles.
8.	Belome: Giant four-eyed dogs cursed with insatiable hunger, the first soldier to fight these monsters will probably be swallowed whole.  But you can satisfy it temporarially by leaving a corpse in its path, then go for the kill.  Also, it has a scarecrow attack that will render your soldiers incapable of attacking.
9.	Great Dragon: Big, fire-breathing monsters.  Using magma on it will turn it into a skeleton, but won't stop it from attacking.
10.	Shadow Siren
11.	Duplighost

# Shroobs

>	Thousands of years ago, it is said, the Mushroom World was not all that different from the mundane Earth.  The transformation occured rapidly, over the course of decades, with the arrival of the Mycon Plague.  Sweeping across the surface of the planet, thousands of species were wiped out entirely by the invisible tendrils of the deadly fungus.  Humanity was nearly wiped out as well.  A small number were able to build up a resistance to the disease, and fled to the deserts, where the fungus had a harder time adapting.  And there were otherse who were able to adapt and merge with the fungus itself, becoming an entirely new species, with a strange and alien substance flowing through their veins.
>	It was thought by some that the plague was an accident, but there were many who thought that it was deliberately created by the Koopa Clan, who had used the newly-discovered secrets of alchemy to grant themselves resistance to the disease before unleashing it upon the world.
>	They were half-right.  The plague was indeed artificial, but the Koopas did not create it.  The plague had actually been planted by the inhabitants of a far-off world.  The substance flowing through the veins of the human-fungus hybrids was a valuable resource to the aliens, used in the creation of long-distance warp drives, and the planet had unwillingly become a farm for its production.  A farm that would one day be harvested.

# Machine Made

>	From the dawn of civilization, the people of our world had gazed at the stars and made wishes upon them, and the most benevolent of stars did all in their power to grant those wishes.  And so hope came upon the world.  The weak could overcome the mighty, the conquerers could be overthrown, the shackles of servitude could be broken.
>	But it was not to last.  A wish was made - a wish that should never have been granted.  A wish that only the strongest should rule, that hope should be stamped out, that life should take its natural course without intervention.  And from this selfish wish was born the Corrupted Star.  Rejected by the stars of the heavens, he fell to earth, and was trapped for a time in the world between worlds.  Barred from access to the powers he sought to destroy, expelled by his very own astral body, he clung to life long enough to construct an artificial shell of steel for himself - a body with which he would fight to fulfill the wish that had created him.
>	They called him the Smith King.  Hidden deep within the mountains, he forged creatures of metal in the likeness of mobile weapons - spears and swords that walked on their own, hammers and drills that crafted new machines and improved upon the old designs.  Harboring a grudge against all life, he and his creations dwell beneath the earth, multiplying and waiting for the day they will break sword upon sword and rule the world as it was meant to be ruled - by the iron fist of the mighty, and the cleansing of the weak.

# The Shadow Queen

>	In a time before time, a great evil emerged from within the deepest depths of the Underworld.  Leading an army of demonic thralls, surrounded by the legions of the dead and the fearsome beasts wrought by her hands, the world was plunged into a thousand years of darkness.  A great war was fought and against all hope, the Lady of Darkness was vanquished, and the Age of Shadows ended at last.  Her disembodied soul was shattered into a thousand pieces, each fragment sealed within one of her dark palaces, buried forever in the depths of the earth.  The demons returned to the Underworld and were sealed there, and the great twisted beasts scattered throughout the depths and were eventually forgotten by those who dwelled in the Light...
>	But the fiends that lurk in the shadows sometimes whisper of a legend.  If a pure soul, untainted by tragedy and slaughter, would be brought into one of her palaces, if a perfect vessel were to be brought as an offering for her disembodied soul, she would once again walk the earth... and a new Age of Shadows would begin.

# Dark Knight of Vanda

>	A being known as the Dark Mage has been watching our world from a parallel dimension, sending his scouts out with the intent of multiversal conquest.  Not to worry - our dimension is not habitable to his kind, so it is not a likely target.  But the Dark Knights themselves are always thirsty for a challenge.  Wielding four elemental crystals and a demon-destroying light, they have been known to periodically wander into the Underworld where the purple light boils and the boundary between dimensions is weak.
>	The Dark Knights of Vanda are a sporting sort and will usually allow a challenger to strike the first blow.  But beware - once engaged in combat, these mighty sorcerer-warriors give no quarter.  Only the strongest will be able to withstand the wrath of the Four Elements and earn the Quartz Charm, the token of their respect.

1. Red is the fire that expands and rises.
2. Blue is the ice that contracts and conceals.
3. Green is the spirit of life that balances between them.  It is the pipes that lead from the Outside to the Inside, the many roads to the place where all points are One.  It is the binding force, found at the Beginning and the End and all points in between.

> The Red Essence is Fire, the Green Essence is Azoth.

> Where is the Azoth?  He dwells in darkness, concealed within all things that grow, for all life is fearful of destruction.  Only the call of Gold can grant him the courage to reveal himself.  Thus do all hearts seek the Shining Gold.

> Who is the Shining Gold?  She is the fallen Star, the growing Flower, the shining Coin that dwells at the heart of all metals.  Only her friend can draw her out.  Who is her friend?  The Carmot Stone.

> How may one find the Carmot Stone?  She is trapped and held captive by the Earth.  Fire or Azoth can burn away the stone that binds her.

> Once there were two brothers, the elder in red, the younger in green.  They heard of a princess who had been kidnapped by a great beast.  They set out on a journey together to rescue her.

> When they came to a castle, they entered and penetrated its depths, casting its ruler into the flames.  But the princess was in another castle.  Thus they traveled from castle to castle, destroying all in their path, until they found her.

> The meaning of this story contains within it the true secret of transmutation, but only the wise will grasp it.
