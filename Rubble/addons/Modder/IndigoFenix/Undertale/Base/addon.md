Long ago, this world was inhabited by a race of monsters...

Monsters come in many shapes and can shoot painful magic bullets, but they are weakened by facing off against aggressive foes who want to kill them. The odds are against you - can you survive on the surface world?

This mod adds the monsters from the game Undertale as a playable race.  Monsters can use magic bullets to attack their foe's willpower directly (using pain effect), but are weakened when running away, or when their enemies want to kill them.  Which is most of the time, being enemies and all.  Also their attack skills drop when they are crying.  Prepare for an extra challenging game if you try to fight your enemies.  You'll have to increase your monsters' combat hardness if you want to fight effectively.

Adventurers may have an easier time, since all RPG adventurers are possessed by the spirit of violence and are therefore able to refrain from self-weakening.  But be warned that if you cause your monster to cry, they will still be weakened.

Monsters come in many shapes; most of them are basically just animal people though.  Some unusual ones are Woshua (who will clean up their allies), Vulkins (who spray magic lava that will heal monsters but burn non-monsters), and Pariahs (who give much-needed combat boosts but have really, really annoying personalities and cause bad thoughts).

I may need some adjustment to actually make it fun to play, but for now enjoy the challenge!
