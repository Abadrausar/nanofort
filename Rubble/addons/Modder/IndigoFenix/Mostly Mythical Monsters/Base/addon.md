[Mostly Mythical Monsters](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=155054.0)

I'm going down Wikipedia's list of mythical creatures and adding everything that looks interesting into DF.
Mostly I'm aiming for creatures with interesting behaviors or abilities, but also adding anything that looks like it could go nicely into vanilla DF.  I am going to try to find creatures with abilities that will force players to adapt their usual strategies rather than being just more of the same.
I will not be changing any base files, nor will I be using DFHack for this mod.  Everything will be modular and self-contained, so anyone who likes parts of it can take out what they like.
I'm also including some of my other mods, the Plump Helmet Men and Return of the Carp God.
Creatures included so far:

Raiju: A fairly small creature that uses short-range electric attacks to stun enemies.  Two unarmed peasants can kill it without injury, but it will stunlock a single legendary melee fighter into oblivion.
Shuck: Whoever hears its howl will die within the year... or so the legend goes.  Actually it's mostly psychosomatic, so you can prevent it by ensuring that the affected target is happy enough to stave off their slow spiral toward melancholy.
Nymph: Can inspire artistic abilities.  Tamable.
Sigbin: Creatures that poop solid gold bars in nest boxes - but if you aren't careful, they might suck your dwarves' blood.  Evil pets.
Wakwak: Scary flying monsters trainable for hunting and war.  Like sigbin, they will feed on your blood if they get the chance.  Evil pets.
Amphisbaena: A flying snake with another snake head for a tail.  Both heads will attack at the same time for a double dose of venom.
Brownie: Kobold-like servants.  You can keep them as pets and they will perform labors for you.  It's like having an extra dwarf.
Redcap: Though only the size of a gnome, these little monsters are vicious and will make short work of civilians.  They live in evil regions.
Leprechaun: Rare creatures that grant wishes.  You will have to chase them down and rough them up a bit first, though.
Ramidreju: A greenish weasel-like pet that will increase the recuperation of nearby allies.  Keep it in your hospital.
Cockatrice: Though not much bigger than a chicken, these monsters can paralyze enemies at a distance with their hiss, making them dangerous to engage alone.  They are tamable though.
Ichneumon: Though smaller than a cat these trainable creatures have amazing physical and mental stats that lets them hold their own against much bigger foes.  They are also extremely resistant to all poisons, completely unaffected by the hiss of the cockatrice, and can even resist dragonfire for a short amount of time.  If you're lucky enough to find yourself a breeding pair, a team of these critters will serve you very well.
Manticore: A lion with the face of a human and the tail of a scorpion.  It also has wings, but cannot actually fly.
The Wild Hunt: A huge group of fae hounds, ravens, beasts, and hunters that will show up rarely in savage biomes and raid your fortress.
Treants: Walking trees living in the joyous wilds.  They will try to destroy your buildings if they catch you in their home.
Bakeneko: Demon cats that raise the dead and turn mundane cats into necromancers.
Sirens: Bird women that inspire confidence and also reduce skills with their song.
Grindylow: River-dwellers that grab at creatures who come down for a drink.
Barbegazi: Just gnomes who live on glaciers.  They will steal alcohol.
Kamaitachi: Flying weasels that attack in trios.  Their slashes contain an anesthetic so they don't hurt much, but they draw a lot of blood.  Be careful!
Griffons: Head of an eagle, body of a lion.  You can train them.
Loong: Chinese dragons.  They are benign and can speak.  They may seek out power.
Qilin: Horned, hooved, dragon-like creatures.  They live in good regions and may seek out power.
Feathered Serpent: Giant flying feathered serpents.  They live in good regions and may seek out power.
Golden Deer: Very rare creatures that run very fast, sacred to the gods of the hunt.  If you see one, chase it - if you keep up the chase and get close enough, you have a chance of gaining a blessing of enhanced speed that manifests the next day.  HOWEVER, don't actually wound it or kill it - its blood and flesh carry a curse for those who harm it.

Playable as Adventurers:

Kappa: When their head-plate is wet from being underwater or in the rain, they gain vampire-like qualities.  You can spill your waterskin and crawl through the puddle to refill your head.  In fort mode, they can be tamed.
Centaur: Half man and half horse in both body and mind.  They have interesting personality traits, being a weird mix of indulgent and cultured.  They are also on the big side and their hooves pack a kick.

Semimegabeasts

Adamant Lion: A big lion with impenetrable skin and claws that can cut through steel armor like tissue paper.  Blunt attacks are your best option.
Gorgon: Can turn you to stone with her gaze.  Before she uses it, you'll be able to close your eyes.  You have to fight her blinded!
Sphinx: A very dangerous predator that asks you questions if you encounter it.  If you answer its questions, it will become much weaker and may even run away.
Chimera: Attacks with fire, venom, claws and hooves.  Has three heads, but only the snake head can attack independently.

Megabeasts

Thunderbird: Smaller than a roc, but uses lightning to attack, with unpredictable effects simulating a real lightning strike.
