My [MODDED] secrets weren't spreading, so I tweaked a few things and well..... (Code in comments) 
Add this to interaction_standard.txt and add a secret_wisdom.txt to objects/text. The blessed still eat and sleep, but I change that for another worldgen.

So whenever they say hello they share the secret? Brilliant!
I could see this technique having other applications, like having a prophet convert people into disciples, or a sorcerer convert people to thralls.

I have been working on something like that, what I would like to give temple performers a 'prosthelytize' interaction, but I don't think that is possible at the moment.

Oh, there's a lot of uses. Masterwork uses it for cults... actually, that's the only really offensive use I know of. I try to avoid that cause I think it's kinda bull. ...Except I've been planning on doing something ludicrously similar, ehheh.

Yea, I don't want my giant tortoises pondering mereological paradoxes rather than laying eggs.

In the secret, they get no-aging, so I am kinds worried.... When I looked at first, the babe was 8 months old. Now, the counter is at 9... But idk whether the baby will become a child then adult...

Oop! 11 months!
ADDED: Nope, we have a permanent baby. The clock counter now says that he was born today, when he was born a year ago.

Hahahaha, this is why I avoid people sharing blessings and such with interactions - leads to utter ridiculousness.
Although I admit having a fort full of pyromancers, biomancers and sorcerers would be nice.
