[CREATURE:CHANGELING]
	[CREATURE_CLASS:ALL_CREATURES]
	[DESCRIPTION:*TRANSFORMS INTO CREATURES IN WORKSHOPS* *HOSTILE MONSTERS - Colosseum/Arena* A small harmless creature with a gelatinous composition. It moves slowly along the ground and eats moss. Changelings have developed a unique survival mechanism, they can transform themselves into any creature. Some say that they can be trained to transform at will. Great care has to be taken when doing so, since the changeling will adapt the traits of the new creature. If one would turn it into a wild beast, this beast would no doubt attack.]
