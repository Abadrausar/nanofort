	header=`"Vampfodder is a mod for Dwarf Fortress by Button. Original concept by the Bay 12 Dwarf Fortress modding forum community. ;)
The "Vampire Fodder" variations modify the blood of applicable creatures to remove during a week [NO_DRINK] from anything that drinks their blood.
This will cause vampires to get thirsty and drink alcohol (if available) in fortress mode, alleviating the effects of sobriety.
Do note that this will replace any other blood modifications you may have made - you'll need to apply them to BLOOD2/ICHOR2 to retain them. "`
