	description=`
On embark you can choose them too (just like changing through dwarf civs in vanilla, it adds occasional drow civs).

It includes a graphic Pack by Chariot modeling the drows in most jobs.
The animals are new graphics by Doctor_Nic

Features:
* 1 new playable entity of drows: underground dwelling dark elves
* 1 new fearsome underground entity: the driders, half drow half spider
* 4 new domestic animals for your drow use: rothe (cattle), giant drowspider (hunting trainable), drowspider (vermin hunter) and giant lizards (war trainable)
* 7 new plants: fire lichen (expensive wine and powder), blue lichen (standard wine), white lichen (clothing), cave barley (standard powder and cheap "slave" drink), cave sugar beet (drink, sugar and syrup), cave strawberry (sweetwine and syrup), poison cup (dont eat it!)
* full set of drow equipment, including parry offhand weapons and the famous drow piwafi
* 2 new metals: mithril and mithral

The drow are evil like goblins and as enemys they mostly feel like them too, but the drow have high end weapons in steel just as dwarves, also beware the females, they are slightly bigger and stronger than the average male drow.
Drider use metal armors, a larger array of weapons and are considerable bigger than the known subterran civs and if you have some on your site: fun ensues!

The Drow civ has many positions:
Grand Matriarch (like Queen, female only)
High Priestess (female only, Matriarchs military officer)
Priestesses (female only, various officers under the high priestess)
Captains (can also be males, more officers under the priestesses)

Site Specific:
Expedition Leader, this is the first noble you will encounter just as with the dwarfs: he or she is on outpost embark site (handels diplomats and work complaints)
House Overseer, after the Outpost grows into a house the expedition leader will become this (main jobs diplomats until the bigger nobles arrives and work complaints)
House Administrator, a merged form of the bookkeeper and manager in one entity, apointable by the player
House Broker, just like normal broker
House Cleric, just like the chief medical dwarf, but also has a squad for law enforcement to keep your fellow drow in place (female only)
House Priestess, this is the military officer inside your outpost (female only)
House Captains, if you need more squads, they will lead them
House Guard Captain, law enforcement for the man (male only!)

Nobles:
Tiny House Matriarch, she will join your fortress rather early, you dont need as much stuff as you would need with the dwarfs, but she doesnt also need much of office or demands
Small House Matriarch, Your site will now be known as "small house"
House Matriarch, after you develop she will maybe get to be no longer a small house matrairch and considered a normal one,
Big House Matriarch, even more wealth has spread.
Great House Matriarch, even greater wealth and strength, you are now very near to attract the grand matriarch herself!

Subnobles:
Weaponmaster, any House Matriarch will appoint a weaponmaster, he acts like the royal guards and has a squad too, and handels executions. basicly a mix of the champion and hammerer.
Tax Collector, the Weaponmaster will not only make the internal secure for the House Matriarch, he will also look into getting economic wealth, so he will appoint the tax collector.
Dungeon Master, just like Dwarfs, Drow love exotic animals, so the nobles will appoint the appropiate dungeon master too.


Drow use the basic elfen language, but unlike their treehugging cousins, they use the darker and evil side of the word spectrum.

Tips:
Use hunters.
	Drow are good hunters and so long as your arrows hold out you can get large amounts of good 
	cheap food without having to worry about diverting farm space. The other animal products gathered 
	are just as valuable, leather is one of the components for the better armor materials and bone 
	makes a good source of hunting/training arrows. In late/mid game hunters can become valuable 
	additions to your military as snipers.

Pay attention to your Drow's castes.
	You can of course just assign anyone to anything but if you try to make sure you match jobs to 
	caste bonuses you can get that extra little bit of performance that can sometimes make a big 
	difference. For example shaman caste saurians make good support troops or doctors but would be 
	wasted as farmers or crafters.

Start a lumber bamboo farm as soon as (or before) you have a sawmill.
	It's hard to see the need for a lumber bamboo farm in the early game (after clear cutting the 
	entire surface of the map for the second or third time you should have hundreds of logs), but you 
	need wood for fuel, building, furniture, and mechanisms, it really doesn't take long to run out. 
	Lumber bamboo farms are low maintenance, so just make a huge farm plot somewhere and start planting.
	This is much less critical with 40.x and the huge amounts of wood that can be had from the new 
	trees, but if you go nuts with wood powered industry lumber bamboo is still VERY useful for when 
	the wood starts to run low.

Buy rare items like gems, silk and stone ASAP (unless you like failed moods).
	If you need raw gems you can "uncut" large gems you trade for at the craftdrow's workshop, if 
	you need cut gems you can use glass. Stone boulders can be pressed from blocks at the 
	craftdrow's workshop, fired from clay at the kiln and batch kiln, or dug up at a quarry. Silk 
	cloth is (generally) only available from trade, if you get lucky and have some aboveground web 
	vermin in the area pen up the cats!

Use glass!
	On most maps glass will make a good, renewable, source of valuable and useful goods. Glass can also 
	be made into rather good weapons and armor (crystal glass is almost as good as steel and clear 
	glass is just as good as iron).
	If you use the "User/Research" addon don't forget that if you use the "User/Warcrafter" addon you 
	can make green glass items without needing to research the glass forge!

Don't forget metal!
    Drow are able to forge mitrhal steel and titanium
	It takes a LONG time to train a smith, but for the absolute best weapons and armor there is no 
	substitute for steel and adamantine.
	One shortcut to keep in mind: If you can train several drows to be novice armor or weapon smiths 
	you may get a legendary smith from a mood if you wait long enough...
