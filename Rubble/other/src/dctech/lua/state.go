// A light weight Go Lua VM designed for easy embedding.
// 
// The compiler generates correct code in every case I have tested, but the code quality is sometimes poor. If
// you want better code quality it is possible to compile scripts with luac and load the binaries...
// 
// Currently the compiler does not support constant folding, and some special instructions are not used at all
// (instead preferring simpler sequences of other instructions). For example TESTSET is never generated, TEST
// is used in all cases (largely because It would greatly complicate the compiler if I tried to use TESTSET
// where possible). Expressions use a simple "recursive" code generation style, meaning that it wastes registers
// like crazy in some (rare) cases.
// 
// Most (if not all) of the API functions may cause a panic, but only if things go REALLY wrong. If a function
// does not state that it can panic or "raise an error" it will only do so if a critical internal assumption
// proves to be wrong (AKA there is a bug in the code somewhere). These errors will have a special prefix
// prepended onto the error message stating that this error indicates an internal VM bug. If you ever see
// such an error I want to know about it ASAP.
// 
// The VM itself does not provide any Lua functions, the standard library is provided entirely by external packages.
// This means that the standard library never does anything that your own code cannot do (there is no "private API"
// that is used by the standard library). 
// 
// Anything to do with the OS or file IO is not provided. Such things do not belong in the core libraries of an
// embedded scripting language (do you really want scripts to be able to read and write random files without
// restriction?).
