Help...
Find me...
Help me...I have been sealed...
I have waited...for such a long time...
Please...Don't leave me here...
Dig...
Oh, pure-hearted one...Approach me...
My spirit requires a vessel...Come closer...
Your body...I need it...
The answer to your questions...lies beneath you...
What do you desire?  Anything you want...I can provide...
The ancient ones sealed me here...find me, and I will reward...
I have been waiting...since the time before time...
Do not make me wait longer...please...
The pain...it is almost too much to bear...
Trapped...below...
My children...
Where are my children...
The Palace of Shadow...
Bring me a pure-hearted vessel...I will reward you...
Restore me...to my full power...
Ressurect me...I can grant you your heart's desire...
I am lost...
At last, a hero has come for me...
My spirit awaits you...
Sealed...for a thousand years...
Save me...
