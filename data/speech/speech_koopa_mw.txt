whose fragile shell was crushed beneath my might
who hid and cowered like a frightened tortoise
who proved that slow and steady does not win the fight
a squirming lizard who trusted too much in [PRO_POS] armor
who was too slow to escape my wrath
who now answers to [PRO_POS] demon liege in the bowels of hell
who would have made a fine soup
