whose remains now feed the forest mushrooms
who should have stayed in the kitchen
who would have gone well on pasta and alfredo sauce
who would have tasted better in a stew
a better cook than fighter
a better cooking ingredient than fighter
who belonged in a cooking pot, not on the battlefield
who was well-minced by the time I finished
a tasty morsel whom I regret not savoring properly
