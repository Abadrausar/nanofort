I am in a rage...
I am in a rage...
I am in a rage...
I am in a rage...
This is it for you!
You are in the presence of hopes far lost.
You hear the sound of rushing wind.
You have made your gravest mistake.
The living have no place here.
You are not welcome.
I am in a rage...
I am in a rage...
I am in a rage...
How dare you set foot in here.
Mortals!
You mere lowly cattle.
You... Are doomed!
You... Are doomed! Hahahah!
Test yourself against the likes of me, will you!?
Who told thee I was here?! I shall crush them too.
