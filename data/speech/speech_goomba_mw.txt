whose soft and fragile head was crushed beneath my feet
who wasn't even worth the trouble
which is hardly worth bragging about
who was only one of many
a pathetic fungus too rotten to eat and too weak to fight
an underling of underlings if there ever was one
who foolishly charged into battle without arms
who was hardly worth a hundred points
whose death came as a mercy
