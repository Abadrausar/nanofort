Your life ends here!
Fate has turned against you!
The stars have spurned you!
Today, you shall fall!
The wheel of fate has turned against you.
Your clock is ticking...
You have been judged, and you have been found wanting.
Today, you meet your doom!
Tremble in fear!
The time of your undoing has come!
Your arrogance shall be your undoing.
