who should have hid [PRO_POS] face better
a pathetic child who should have stayed inside
who should have stuck to playing with blocks
who learned all too late that life is not all fun and games
who was really unspeakably ugly beneath [PRO_POS] mask
who did not belong in this world in the first place
who lived fast and died young
