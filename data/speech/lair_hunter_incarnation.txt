You hear the approach of a storm.
You hear a grievous clap of thunder.
You hear rolling thunder.
You hear the approach of a storm.
You hear a grievous clap of thunder.
You hear condescending laughter.
You hear a whisper, "Have you any sense?"
You hear the approach of a storm.
You hear a grievous clap of thunder.
You hear rolling thunder.
You hear the approach of a storm.
You hear a grievous clap of thunder.
You hear condescending laughter.
You hear a billowing voice, "Dare you?"
